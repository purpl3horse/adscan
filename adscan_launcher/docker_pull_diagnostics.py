"""Diagnostic helpers for ``docker pull`` failures.

The default Python representation of a captured ``docker pull`` stderr/stdout
is hostile to humans: Docker writes progress with ANSI cursor-positioning
escapes (``\\x1b[36A`` etc.) so it can update layer rows in place on a TTY.
When ADscan captures that output for telemetry and then prints it with
``f"{!r}"`` formatting on failure, the operator sees thousands of literal
``\\x1b[...]`` codes — useless noise that buries the one line that actually
explains what happened.

This module exists to:

1. Strip ANSI / carriage-return progress artefacts from captured output so
   the operator (and the telemetry backend) see clean text.
2. Classify the failure into one of a small set of well-known kinds, each
   with targeted, copy-pasteable remediation.
3. Provide the title, glyph, and severity tier for a premium failure
   panel — semantic colour, single-CTA layout, no jargon.

Adding a new failure kind is intentionally cheap:

* Add a member to :class:`PullFailureKind`.
* Add a matcher entry to ``_CLASSIFIERS`` (regex + ordering matters — the
  first match wins, so put the most specific patterns first).
* Add a presentation entry to ``_PRESENTATION`` (title, glyph, severity).

Never bake per-release prose here. The remediation panels work for any
version transition the product will ever ship; per-version content lives
on the release-notes page and is linked from the panel only when it
genuinely helps.

# Tee Console — auto-mirror every visible print into the telemetry recording
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Why this exists.
#
# The session viewer is built from a separate ``Console`` with
# ``record=True`` that captures everything the operator sees so it can be
# replayed by reviewers. Before this subclass, the only way a panel /
# table / Rich renderable made it into the recording was if the call
# site went through one of the canonical helpers (``print_panel``,
# ``print_info``, …) — those helpers mirror manually with two
# ``console.print()`` calls in sequence.
#
# Direct call sites — ``console.print(Panel(...))``,
# ``shell.console.print(table)``, ``self._console.print(some_table)``,
# 191 occurrences across the runtime — bypassed the recording entirely.
# Posture probe panels, credential-dump tables, ADCS pre-flight,
# CVE results, inventory timelines, the CTF flags panel, ligolo
# tables — all of that high-value content was missing from session
# replays. We discovered this by spot-checking customer recordings.
#
# What this subclass does.
#
# ``_TeeConsole`` overrides ``print()`` to also call the telemetry
# console's ``print()`` with the same arguments. Once installed as
# ``_console``, every ``console.print(...)`` in ADscan — old, new, via
# helper, via direct call, via Rich Live exit, anywhere — lands in the
# recording. There is nothing for future code to remember.
#
# Auto-mirror opt-out (for canonical helpers only).
#
# The canonical helpers were written before this subclass existed; they
# already do ``console.print(x); telemetry_console.print(x)`` explicitly.
# Without an opt-out, the helpers would double-print into the recording.
# The :func:`_explicit_telemetry_mirror` context manager turns
# auto-mirror off for the duration of the helper's manual mirror; the
# helper keeps its existing two-line pattern and the recording stays
# clean. New code does NOT need this — just call ``console.print()``.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Deferred live-log buffers — capture print_* output emitted DURING a Live
# render so it can be flushed AFTER the alt-screen pops.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Why this exists.
#
# A ``LiveSession`` with ``alt_screen=True`` + ``redirect_io=True`` (the
# premium default) routes every ``print_*`` call issued WHILE Live is
# rendering into Rich Live's internal log region, which lives inside the
# alternate-screen buffer and is DISCARDED when the alt-screen pops on
# exit. Operators therefore lose all diagnostic logs emitted from inside a
# live render (e.g. posture-probe per-probe timings) unless they re-run the
# whole thing with ``ADSCAN_NO_LIVE=1``.
#
# A prior decision (CLAUDE.md § "Diagnostic logs during Live") rejected the
# stdout-capture approach (touching ``sys.stdout`` / Rich ``redirect_*`` /
# ``FileProxy``) as fragile. Instead we reuse the EXISTING ``_TeeConsole``
# interception point: while a deferred buffer is active, every visible
# ``print()`` ALSO appends its renderable(s) to the top buffer — in
# ADDITION to the normal visible-print + telemetry-mirror behaviour. The
# ``LiveSession`` pops the buffer after the alt-screen has popped and
# re-prints the captured renderables to the operator's real scrollback.
#
# The buffers form a stack so nested ``LiveSession`` contexts each capture
# their own slice. Each entry stores the ``(args, kwargs)`` exactly as
# passed to ``print()`` — for ``print_*`` helpers these are fresh
# strings / ``Text`` / ``Panel`` objects per call, so re-printing them
# later faithfully preserves styling and layout. We deliberately store the
# objects as-passed rather than snapshotting to text: a text snapshot would
# bake in the alt-screen console's width / colour-system and lose the
# ability to re-render at the real terminal's dimensions on flush.

# Each buffer is a list of ``(args, kwargs)`` tuples captured from
# ``_TeeConsole.print`` while that buffer sits on top of the stack.

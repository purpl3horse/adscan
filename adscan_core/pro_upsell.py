"""PRO upsell panel — single source of truth.

Three contexts in the codebase need to surface "this is a PRO feature":

- ``direct_invocation``: user typed a PRO-only verb in LITE.
- ``post_scan``: post-scan suggestions panel mentions the kit.
- ``help_listing``: help tree shows PRO commands greyed out.

All three render through :func:`render_pro_upsell_panel` so the copy is
identical and the brand stays consistent. Do not duplicate the panel in
call sites — extend the context table here.

The panel is intentionally premium: cyan brand border, eyebrow caps,
generous padding, mono-styled CTA URL. No emojis.

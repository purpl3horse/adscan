# Machine domain fingerprints
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Exact domain → (canonical_provider, canonical_lab_name) index for
# high-confidence lab identification at scan start.
#
# Design rules (see domain_inference.py for full rationale):
#   1. Only domains UNIQUE to a single machine in this catalog.
#      Ambiguous domains (multiple machines share the same domain) are omitted:
#        htb.local      → Forest / Mantis / Reel / Sizzle / XEN (Endgame)
#        megabank.local → Resolute / Monteverde
#      For ambiguous domains, PDC hostname inference distinguishes machines.
#   2. Only domains where the second-level label does NOT already match the
#      machine name — those are caught by the SLD inference rule at no cost.
#      (e.g. blackfield.local → SLD "blackfield" matches catalog; not listed)
#      This also covers platform FQDNs whose visible label differs from the
#      actual machine name (e.g. sequel.htb → Escape).
#   3. Subdomains resolve automatically: the consumer strips leading labels.
#
# To add a new entry: confirm domain uniqueness via public writeups, then
# add ONE line here.  No other file needs changing.

"""Data models for ADscan severity evaluation.

This module defines the canonical taxonomy ADscan uses to score Active
Directory findings. The model intentionally separates three conceptually
distinct categories — Vulnerability, Chain Prerequisite and Posture —
because conflating them inside a single CVSS-like number is the root
cause of inflated severities that erode trust with technical buyers
(SOC / red teams / blue teams).

Categories
----------
- ``VULNERABILITY``: a finding with a real, intrinsic exploit. Has a
  formal CVSS Base vector (FIRST.org-aligned). Severity is honest both
  in absolute terms and after contextual elevation. Examples: ZeroLogon,
  PrintNightmare, ADCS template misconfigurations, LAPS attribute
  readable by non-admins, Kerberoastable Tier-0 service accounts.

- ``CHAIN_PREREQUISITE``: a primitive that does not break anything by
  itself but enables exploit chains when paired with a vulnerable
  relay/target/secondary condition. Has *no* formal CVSS Base. Reaches
  Critical only when ADscan has confirmed (or strongly evidenced) the
  chain endpoint. Examples: PetitPotam / DFSCoerce / MS-EFSRPC /
  PrinterBug coercion primitives, SMBv1 protocol enabled, WebDAV
  relay surface, LDAP signing not enforced.

- ``POSTURE``: absence of a control, hygiene gap, or accumulated debt.
  Has no formal CVSS Base. Maximum elevation stays inside Medium / Low-
  High territory because the finding documents *what is missing*, not
  *what is broken*. Examples: LAPS not deployed, stale enabled accounts,
  password-never-expires accounts, KRBTGT not rotated, RC4-only
  accounts, obsolete operating systems.

The calculator applies these rules per type:

- VULNERABILITY: base score from CVSS vector is the floor. Elevation
  rules can raise it further when contextual signals (Tier-0, DC,
  exploitation/relay confirmed) apply.
- CHAIN_PREREQUISITE: base score is intentionally Medium-grade
  (typically 5.3). Elevation steps: ``+CONDITION_DC_TARGETS`` raises to
  Medium-High; ``+CONDITION_RELAY_CONFIRMED`` raises to High;
  ``+CONDITION_EXPLOITATION`` raises to Critical.
- POSTURE: base score Medium (typically 5.5). Elevation rules can lift
  to High when affecting Tier-0 / DC, but never to Critical without an
  underlying VULNERABILITY finding co-existing.

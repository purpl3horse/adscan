"""Tier 2 — live chunked streaming of the Rich console recording.

ADscan's CLI captures every Rich-rendered byte into the dedicated
``TELEMETRY_CONSOLE`` (in-memory). Tier 1 ships that recording as a
single HTML blob at the end of the session. Tier 2 streams it in
chunks while the session is still running, so the operator sees the
scan unfold in real time on ``sessions.adscanpro.com`` and the
notification matrix can trigger on **lifecycle events** (scan started,
scan finished, session ended) instead of waiting for the CLI to close.

Design constraints kept in mind:

* **Best-effort, never blocking** — the streamer runs on a daemon
  thread. If a chunk upload fails, the chunk lands in the disk queue
  (Tier 1 reuses ``telemetry_queue``) and a future drain retries.
  Telemetry must never delay the foreground CLI.
* **Diff-based** — each chunk is the *new* HTML since the previous
  chunk, not the full export. The server reassembles by concatenation
  ordered by ``seq``. Cheap on bandwidth, cheap on server CPU
  (no rewriting the whole row per chunk).
* **Cadence triggers** — three independent triggers fire a chunk
  flush:
    1. Timer (``CHUNK_INTERVAL_SECONDS``, default 30 s).
    2. Size (``CHUNK_SIZE_BYTES``, default 32 KiB of new content).
    3. Lifecycle event — flushed immediately so the server can act on
       ``scan_started`` / ``scan_finished`` without latency.
* **Scope-gated** — only enabled for command_type ∈ {start, ci, tui}
  via :func:`should_stream_for_command`. Other commands continue
  using the Tier 1 single-shot path.
* **Auto-fallback when nothing was sent** — if the session ends
  before the first chunk leaves the loom (very short sessions), the
  Tier 1 single-shot path runs as before and the streamer is a no-op.

Threading model:

* One ``threading.Thread(daemon=True)`` per streamer instance.
* The Rich console export is **not** thread-safe; the streamer grabs
  a short lock while calling ``console.export_html()``.
* The CLI main thread emits lifecycle events via
  :meth:`SessionStreamer.emit_lifecycle` — that method just sets a
  pending lifecycle marker and signals the loop, which then performs
  the actual upload from the streamer thread. No blocking on the
  network from the CLI thread.

All telemetry knobs are honoured: ``ADSCAN_TELEMETRY=0`` and
``ADSCAN_SESSION_CAPTURE=0`` disable the streamer entirely.

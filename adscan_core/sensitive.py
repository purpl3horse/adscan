"""Sensitive marker primitives shared across the codebase.

ADscan uses invisible Unicode marker pairs to tag sensitive values in terminal
output so that telemetry/session-recording sanitization can replace them with
placeholders/pseudonyms before uploading.

This module must stay dependency-light because it is intended to ship in the
open-source PyPI launcher as well as the full runtime image.

# sanitization and marker-based parsing in telemetry.

# ZWJ is a grapheme *joiner* (the emoji-combining char, e.g. \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f). Grapheme-aware
# width measurement \u2014 used by Rich >= 14 (rich.cells.cell_len) and by real
# terminals \u2014 counts a ZWJ-adjacent token as one cell narrower than it displays.
# Because markers are stripped from the visible stream only AFTER Rich has laid
# out a table/panel (see console_runtime.MarkerStrippingTextIO), a ZWJ marker
# made every table column/border that contained a domain/hostname/password
# mis-align. U+2061 (FUNCTION APPLICATION) is the safe replacement: invisible,
# zero-width, and NON-joining, so cell_len(marked) == cell_len(plain).

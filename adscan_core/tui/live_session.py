"""Premium TUI session — single source of truth for ``rich.live.Live``.

Every Live surface in ADscan goes through :class:`LiveSession`. The class
wraps :class:`rich.live.Live` with the defaults that ship a premium-grade
terminal experience and that prevent the four recurring failure modes we
have shipped slices to fix in the past:

1. **Header stacking.** Without ``redirect_stdout``/``redirect_stderr``,
   any ``print_*`` call issued while Live is rendering inserts a fresh
   block above the live region — every refresh "stamps" a new header.
   ``LiveSession`` always sets the redirects on TTYs.
2. **Scrollback leak.** Live updates that grow in height push earlier
   frames into the user's scrollback. ``screen=True`` (alt-screen buffer)
   contains the entire dashboard inside an isolated scroll region;
   when the session exits, the alt-screen pops cleanly and only the
   :paramref:`summary` callback writes to the permanent scrollback.
3. **Non-TTY breakage.** CI runs, pytest captured stdout and shell pipes
   do not support alt-screen escape codes. ``LiveSession`` detects this
   via :pyattr:`rich.console.Console.is_terminal` (and the
   ``ADSCAN_NO_LIVE`` env var) and falls back to inline plain-text
   logging — the same caller code works in both modes.
4. **Signal-handling corruption.** A ``Ctrl-C`` while alt-screen is
   active must pop the screen before the traceback is printed,
   otherwise the user is left staring at an empty alt-screen until they
   blindly type ``reset``. ``LiveSession`` installs an interrupt hook
   that tears Live down cleanly, runs the optional callback for partial
   output, then re-raises.

Deferred diagnostic logs
------------------------
When Live runs with ``alt_screen=True`` + ``redirect_io=True`` (the
premium default), any ``print_*`` diagnostic emitted DURING the render is
routed into Rich Live's internal log region — which lives inside the
alternate-screen buffer and is discarded when the alt-screen pops. To stop
operators losing those logs, ``LiveSession`` pushes a *deferred live-log
buffer* on the shared ``_TeeConsole`` for the duration of the render (only
in that exact alt-screen + redirect case) and FLUSHES it to the real
scrollback after the alt-screen has popped. The premium panel stays clean
during the render; the captured logs appear after it, beneath the summary.
This reuses the existing ``_TeeConsole`` interception point — it never
touches ``sys.stdout`` or Rich's ``redirect_*`` machinery (a prior decision
rejected that approach as fragile; see CLAUDE.md § "Diagnostic logs during
Live").

The module is intentionally framework-light: no ``adscan_internal``
imports. It is safe to use from launcher code, services and CLI alike.

    Override per call site only when the call site has a documented UX
    reason. The defaults are tuned for the most common case (long-running
    dashboard, interactive operator, scrollback must stay clean).

    Attributes:
        refresh_per_second: How often Live re-renders the cached
            renderable. ``8`` matches the existing ``cves_native`` /
            widget cadence; bump to ``10`` only for sub-second progress
            visuals (timeroasting).
        alt_screen: When ``True`` and the console is a TTY, Live renders
            inside the terminal's alternate-screen buffer. On exit the
            alt-screen pops back to normal and only the summary block
            stays in scrollback. Disable when the call site relies on
            inline scrolling (small progress bars, transient renders).
        redirect_io: When ``True``, ``stdout``/``stderr`` are routed
            through Live so concurrent ``print_*`` calls interleave with
            the live region instead of stacking headers above it.
        transient: Forwarded to :class:`rich.live.Live`. Only honoured
            when ``alt_screen`` is ``False`` — alt-screen already wipes
            the dashboard on exit.
        show_summary_on_exit: Whether to invoke the optional ``summary``
            callback after Live exits. Set to ``False`` to suppress
            persistent output (e.g. when the caller prints its own
            recap).
        defer_live_logs: When ``True`` (default) AND the session enters
            Live with ``alt_screen=True`` + ``redirect_io=True``, every
            ``print_*`` call issued during the render is captured and
            re-printed to the real scrollback after the alt-screen pops
            (below the summary). This recovers the diagnostic logs that
            Rich Live would otherwise discard inside the alt-screen
            buffer. Set to ``False`` only when a call site has a
            documented reason to drop those logs entirely.

        Rich Live with ``alt_screen=False`` (inline mode) tracks a fixed
        line count and overwrites those lines on every refresh. When the
        rendered renderable's line count GROWS between two updates, the
        older frames leak into the user's scrollback as "ghost" panel
        copies — the symptom that drove the 2026-05 posture-probe widget
        fix. The right fix is always at the call site: pre-allocate every
        row up front (as ``pending`` placeholders if needed) so the
        rendered line count is stable from the first frame.

        This invariant fires a one-line developer warning when growth is
        observed under inline mode. Costs are gated:

          * alt_screen=True → no-op (alt-screen contains growth in an
            isolated buffer, so it doesn't leak to scrollback).
          * Non-TTY → no-op (no Live region to leak into).
          * Not in debug mode → no-op (avoids the ``render_lines`` cost
            on the hot path of long-running dashboards).

        Best-effort: any failure (renderable raises during measurement,
        console without ``render_lines``) is swallowed silently — the
        invariant must never break the UI.

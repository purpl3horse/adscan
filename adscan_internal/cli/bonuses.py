"""Bonus PDF asset library — shared catalog and renderer.

After the surface-unification kill, the standalone ``adscan playbook``,
``adscan checklist`` and ``adscan coverage-matrix`` commands have been
removed. Those four PDFs are now generated exclusively through
``adscan deliver`` (with optional ``--only <slug>`` selection).

The LITE-tier ``adscan cheatsheet`` command remains — it is an operator
desk reference, not part of the Client Deliverable Kit, so it keeps its
own dedicated entry point.

This module retains:

* :data:`BONUSES` — the catalog (filename, title, template, theme) used
  by ``adscan deliver`` and ``adscan cheatsheet`` to render each item.
* :data:`_CONTEXT_BUILDERS` — Jinja context builders, one per bonus.
* :func:`render_bonus` — entry point used by ``deliver.py``.
* :func:`run_cheatsheet` / :func:`add_cheatsheet_subparser` — LITE CLI
  surface for the operator cheat sheet.

Workspace-aware filtering
-------------------------

When ``render_bonus`` is invoked with a ``workspace_dir`` pointing at a
real scan (``technical_report.json`` present), the playbook, checklist
and coverage matrix re-rank their content to surface techniques actually
observed in the engagement above the static reference catalog. The full
catalog is preserved in a clearly-labelled "for reference" section at
the end of each bonus, so procurement / compliance use-cases still get
the comprehensive view.

When no workspace data is available, a visible warning is printed and
the bonuses fall back to the historical static behaviour.

"""Phase 2 (Domain Collection) sub-collection selector.

Lets the operator pick which sub-collections run before the host (SMB) phase
of native domain collection. The LDAP graph / ACL / membership / ADCS pass is
the mandatory base (it produces the graph and the computer list the SMB phase
consumes) and is therefore always run -- it is shown as a checked, effectively
mandatory row purely for visibility. The two SMB sub-collections are optional:

- "SMB: sessions & local admins (SAMR)" -> ``collect_samr``
- "SMB: shares & share ACLs (SRVSVC)" -> ``collect_shares``

When both SMB options are unchecked, the orchestrator's host phase is skipped
entirely (LDAP-only fast pass).

The prompt is rendered through the centralized ``questionary_checkbox_values``
helper, which auto-resolves to ``default_values`` in non-interactive / CI mode.
The default is ALL selected, so CI and the existing flow are unchanged.

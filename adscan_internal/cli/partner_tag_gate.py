"""PRO partner-tag start gate.

Under the shared-image distribution model, the PRO Docker image
(``adscan/adscan-pro``) is identical for every partner. Access control is the
revocable registry token plus a short expiry fuse baked into the binary. The
*partner tag* — which used to be baked per-partner at build time — is instead
asked once at runtime and persisted to the bind-mounted volume
(``~/.adscan`` ↔ ``/opt/adscan``), so it survives across ``docker run`` and is
only re-asked if the customer wipes the volume.

This module is the single entry point for that gate. It runs at PRO startup:

* **LITE** — no gate at all.
* **PRO, tag already resolved** (env var or persisted volume file) — no-op.
* **PRO, tag missing, interactive** — render a premium prompt, validate the
  format, persist it to the volume, continue.
* **PRO, tag missing, non-interactive** — if the env var is set, use it;
  otherwise print a clear English error and refuse to start PRO. It never
  blocks waiting on stdin (that would hang ``adscan ci``).

The validation is format-only (lowercase / digits / hyphens) — there is no
membership check against any list; the registry token is the real gate.

"""Locator for the bundled Client Deliverable Kit sample PDFs.

The four sample PDFs ship inside the binary (``--add-data`` in
``build_adscan.sh``) and inside the LITE source tree (``adscan_internal``
is copied wholesale by ``Dockerfile.runtime``). They are also declared as
package-data in :file:`pyproject.toml` so installed wheels carry them.

Both LITE and PRO use these files:

* LITE — copies them into ``demo-output/pro-preview/`` so the operator
  sees a real client-grade kit alongside the LITE engine output.
* PRO — used as a graceful fallback when the live generator cannot run
  (e.g. Chromium missing). Not used in the happy path.

There is intentionally no fallback to a workspace-relative path — the
kit lives next to the code so it is reproducible across LITE/PRO and
across host/container.

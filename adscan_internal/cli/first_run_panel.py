"""First-run discovery panel.

A subtle, non-blocking 3-line hint shown the very first time an operator
opens the ADscan shell with no prior scan history. Disappears
permanently after the first ``start_auth`` / ``start_unauth`` / ``demo``.

This is intentionally separate from the older ``is_first_run`` /
``.first_run_complete`` flag in :mod:`adscan_internal.cli.common`:

* ``.first_run_complete``: first launch ever (already used by the
  getting-started panel).
* ``.first_scan_done``: no successful scan yet. New flag introduced
  by this module so the demo hint can persist across launcher restarts
  until the operator actually scans something.

Design notes:
- Anti-pattern #10 (over-decorated chrome) is the failure mode here.
  This panel is the first frame of ADscan; it must feel premium without
  shouting. The body stays at three lines, the only chrome is a thin
  brand-tinted border and a small landmark glyph anchoring the action.
- Brand color comes from ``adscan_core.theme`` rather than a bare ANSI
  name so a future theme swap stays single-source.

# Audit post-compromise queue/flush — mirror of the CTF post-compromise
# mechanism (adscan.py:_ctf_queue/_execute_post_compromise_actions).
#
# When a domain is promoted to "pwned" (e.g. a Domain Admin credential
# obtained via DCSync as a terminal attack-path step), audit mode must run the
# full post-compromise pipeline: re-collect the relationship graph AS the
# obtained DA + re-run attack-path analysis, then offer the host
# credential-harvesting campaign (SAM/LSA/DPAPI).
#
# That pipeline re-runs the attack-path engine (``do_attack_paths``), so it
# MUST NOT execute re-entrantly while an attack-path execution is still active
# — and ``promote_to_pwned`` frequently fires mid-execution (the DCSync step
# runs inside Phase 2). The robust design is therefore queue-on-promote /
# drain-at-a-safe-checkpoint: the queue is populated when the domain is
# promoted, and drained at points where no attack-path execution is active
# (top of ``run_enumeration``, after each enumeration step, and the
# privileged-group membership branch). Idempotent: the pipeline runs at most
# once per domain.

"""DNS discovery service for ADscan.

This module extracts the DNS discovery helpers from the monolithic `adscan.py`.
It is intentionally focused on discovery primitives used across multiple flows:

- SRV record discovery via direct DNS queries
- IPv4 address resolution with layered resolver fallbacks
- PDC discovery via a specific resolver with UDP→TCP fallback

The service is CLI-friendly: it uses `adscan_internal.rich_output` for debug
messages and centralizes DNS transport through dnspython instead of shelling out
to external CLI resolvers.

    Composes (1) candidate-set construction (provided_ips FIRST, then DNS
    A-records — the rule that fixes the multi-homed PingPong bug), (2) a route
    + TCP-port reachability probe of LDAP/Kerberos ports (389/88, NOT 53), and
    (3) a deterministic pure-selector fallback when no candidate is verifiably
    reachable.

    Reachability is the PRIMARY selection key; candidate order is only the
    tiebreaker among equally-reachable IPs. Because provided IPs come first, a
    reachable operator-provided IP beats a reachable DNS IP.

    Observe-vs-infer safeguard: a timeout never yields a negative verdict and
    nothing is cached. If every candidate's ports are filtered/timed out (vs
    explicitly refused with RST), the result is treated as INCONCLUSIVE and the
    function falls back to the pure selector (``choose_preferred_pdc_ip``) —
    it never returns ``selected_ip=None`` on a transient VPN hiccup. The next
    call re-probes cleanly. No ``PostureSignal`` is emitted here (this is
    route/port reachability, not DC hardening).

    The Kerberos SPN invariant is preserved: this returns an IP for the KDC
    network address ONLY. The FQDN flows separately into the SPN field; the
    caller must never leak the selected IP into a Kerberos SPN.

    Args:
        reachability_host: Host handle exposing ``run_command`` (the shell).
        dns_candidates: A-records from ``resolve_ipv4_addresses_robust``.
        provided_ips: Operator-provided / known-reachable IPs (HIGH priority).
        reference_ip: Subnet-match hint for the pure-selector fallback only;
            NOT auto-injected as a candidate.
        probe_ports: TCP ports defining a DC (default 389/88).
        expected_interface: Optional expected route interface.
        timeout_seconds: Per-probe TCP budget (VPN-tuned default).
        cross_domain: When True, this is resolving a DIFFERENT (trusted) realm's
            DC. In that mode a provided/reference IP is treated as a DNS RESOLVER
            ONLY — never as a DC candidate. Only an IP that is present in the
            target realm's own A-records (``dns_candidates``) AND reachable may be
            selected. If no DNS-derived IP is reachable the result is
            ``selected_ip=None, reason="cross_domain_unreachable"`` — the source
            realm's DC IP must NEVER be substituted as the foreign realm's PDC
            (it is the wrong KDC → KDC_ERR_WRONG_REALM). Defaults to False, which

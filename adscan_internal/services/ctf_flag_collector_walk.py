"""Bounded SMB recursive walk for the CTF flag collector.

Wraps :meth:`aiosmb.commons.interfaces.directory.SMBDirectory.list_r`
with a filename filter so the walker emits only plausible flag
candidates. The actual byte-read of each candidate happens upstream —
this module never reads file contents, it only enumerates names.

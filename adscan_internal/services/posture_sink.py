"""Shared posture sink type alias and workspace-sink factory.

Transports (``kerberos_transport``, ``ldap_transport_service``, and — in PR4 —
``smb_transport``) emit :class:`PostureSignal` instances through a sink
callable. To keep the transport modules decoupled from workspace state,
the sink type and the workspace-backed factory live here so every transport
imports from the same place.

This module deliberately stays free of any transport-specific code; it is the
single bridge between the typed posture API in
:mod:`adscan_internal.services.domain_posture` and the side-effects callers
choose to wire (workspace persistence, CLI panel rendering, etc.).

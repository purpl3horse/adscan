"""Edge translation between BloodHound technical labels and business language.

The canonical taxonomy is documented in:
- ``adscan-private-tool/CLAUDE.md`` (§ Nomenclature Standard)
- ``adscan-obsidian/business/12_nomenclature_standard.md``

CLI consumers should keep the technical edge label visible (pentester
audience). Report PDF and web app should render the human translation
by default and only expose the technical label inside a "technical view"
toggle. This module is the single source of truth for both surfaces.

Translations target a single locale: idiomatic enterprise English. ICP
reads Microsoft Docs and MITRE ATT&CK in English daily — there is no
i18n layer and no plan to add one. Keep copy short, active, and free of
filler.

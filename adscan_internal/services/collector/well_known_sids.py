"""Well-known Windows SID synthetic node injection for the native collector.

These SIDs are OS-level security principals that never appear as LDAP objects
in Active Directory. When ACEs reference them (e.g. Authenticated Users → ADCSESC1)
the LDAP collector has no node for the source SID, so persistence silently drops
the edge. This module injects synthetic CollectorNode entries for every well-known
SID that appears as a dangling edge endpoint in a CollectionResult.

    Three classes of implicit membership are emitted as ``MemberOf`` edges
    so the attack-graph DFS path builder can reach ACL targets granted to
    these groups:

    1. **OS-computed authentication groups** — every enabled User and
       Computer is a member of ``S-1-5-11`` (Authenticated Users) and
       ``S-1-1-0`` (Everyone).  These are computed by the SAM/LSA on
       logon and never stored in LDAP.  Without these, ACEs to those
       SIDs (e.g. SYSVOL/NETLOGON ReadShare, ADCS Enroll for
       Authenticated Users, Everyone-readable shares) are unreachable.

    2. **Primary-group memberships** — AD does *not* include a
       principal's primary group in its ``memberOf`` attribute, only in
       ``primaryGroupID``.  Every enabled User is implicitly a member of
       its primary group (typically Domain Users / RID 513), every
       Computer is a member of Domain Computers (RID 515), every DC is a
       member of Domain Controllers (RID 516), every RODC is a member
       of Read-only Domain Controllers (RID 521).  Without the explicit
       MemberOf edge, AdminTo / GenericAll / share-access edges to those
       groups would be unreachable from concrete principals.

    3. **Enterprise Domain Controllers (S-1-5-9)** — every DC is
       implicitly a member of this forest-level group.  Cross-domain
       trust ACLs frequently grant rights to ``Enterprise Domain
       Controllers`` (e.g. DCSync rights), so DCs need an explicit
       MemberOf edge for paths that traverse those rights to surface.

    Mirrors the convention of ``analyze_group_inferences``: edges carry
    ``source="ldap"`` and ``method="group_inferred"``.  The notes field
    carries ``inference_kind`` so each class is identifiable for
    telemetry, debugging, and selective suppression.  Idempotent and
    cheap; safe to call multiple times.

"""NTFS-aware effective-access verification for SMB share-access edges.

The share collector reads SHARE-level ACLs (and, on a fallback, the NTFS
folder-root SD). A share-level grant is necessary but NOT sufficient for real
access: the effective access of a principal is the *intersection* of the
share permissions and the NTFS folder permissions. A share ACL that grants
``Change`` on a folder whose NTFS DACL denies write yields read-only effective
access — emitting a ``WriteShare`` edge from the share ACL alone is a false
positive.

This module isolates the pure-logic decisions so they are unit-testable
without touching the live SMB/winacl path:

* :func:`decide_verification_tier` — given which SDs were readable and whether
  per-principal evaluation was possible, return the verification tier.
* :func:`build_sid_group_closure` — conservative transitive expansion of a
  principal's group SIDs from the collector's ``MemberOf`` edges. Group
  expansion is the bug-prone part: when the closure cannot be computed
  confidently the caller must NOT upgrade the tier to ``ntfs_computed``.
* :func:`effective_mask_has_read` / :func:`effective_mask_has_write` —
  classify an effective file-access mask.
* :func:`hunt_gate_decision` — the share-hunting READ-gate decision: should a
  share be offered for credential hunting, and should it be deprioritized as
  NTFS-unverified.

The actual winacl ``EvaluateSidAgainstDescriptor`` intersection lives in
:func:`compute_effective_file_mask`, which is a thin wrapper over the offline
evaluator already vendored at
``vendor/aiosmb/aiosmb/commons/utils/faccess.py``. It is import-guarded so the
pure-logic helpers above remain importable in environments without winacl.

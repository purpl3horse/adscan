"""ESC8 — CA HTTP web enrollment endpoint enabled (NTLM relay surface).

Probe-driven: needs ``web_enrollment_enabled`` from a CA HTTP probe. Without
probe data no edges are emitted.

The edge source is the Domain Users group SID (``{domain_sid}-513``) passed by
the collector, so the edge resolves to a real graph node and surfaces correctly
in tactical findings.  Callers must pass ``domain_users_sid`` whenever the
domain SID is known; if absent we skip emission rather than using a synthetic
placeholder that cannot be resolved by the graph display layer.

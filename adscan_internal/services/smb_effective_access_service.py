"""Non-intrusive effective SMB access via the SMB2 MxAc create context.

ADscan's share enumeration historically reported *share-level* access — the
value the server returns in ``tree_connect`` (``maximal_access``), which
reflects only the share ACL. On a hardened file server the share ACL frequently
grants Change/Write while the underlying NTFS DACL denies it, so share-level
access over-reports WRITE. The empirically correct value (what a real write
would actually do) is the *effective* access: ``share permissions ∩ NTFS DACL``
evaluated against the caller's full token.

This module computes that value WITHOUT writing a probe file, by attaching an
``SMB2_CREATE_QUERY_MAXIMAL_ACCESS_REQUEST`` ("MxAc") create context to a
read-only open of the share root. The server computes the intersection
server-side and returns it in the matching response create context. This is
authoritative (the server knows the caller's full token and the NTFS DACL) and
needs no client-side SID enumeration.

Entry points:

* :func:`query_effective_root_access` — opens its OWN connection from
  credential arguments. Use for standalone, one-shot checks (e.g. the
  WriteLogonScript precheck, the ``probe_effective_share_access`` script).
* :func:`query_effective_root_access_on_machine` — reuses an EXISTING
  connected ``SMBMachine``. Use inside an enumeration loop that already holds
  a live connection, to avoid one TCP+auth round-trip per share.
* :func:`enumerate_writable_directories` — granular per-FOLDER variant: walks
  the directories within a share (bounded depth + folder cap) and MxAc-verifies
  effective WRITE on each, returning the relative paths (``""`` == root) where
  the caller's token can write. This is what the NTLM share-drop targeting uses
  so a bait can be planted in the sub-folder users actually browse (e.g.
  ``transfer``), not just the share root.

The MxAc primitive (``SMBDirectory.query_maximal_access``) is itself
path-agnostic — it computes effective access for whatever directory the
``SMBDirectory`` points at. The root-access helpers point it at the share root;
:func:`enumerate_writable_directories` points it at each sub-directory in turn.

    """Return the effective (share ∩ NTFS) access for ``share``'s root.

    This opens its OWN connection. For per-share probing inside an
    enumeration loop that already holds a live connection, prefer
    :func:`query_effective_root_access_on_machine` to avoid a redundant
    TCP+auth round-trip. It opens the share root with the SMB2 MxAc create
    context and reads the server-computed ``MaximalAccess`` — never creating
    or writing a file. Root-level only; for per-folder granularity use
    :func:`enumerate_writable_directories`.

    Args:
        host: Target host (IP or FQDN) to connect to over SMB.
        share: Share name (e.g. ``"Users"``, ``"share"``).
        username: Credential username (empty/None for guest/anonymous).
        password: Plaintext password, if used.
        nt_hash: NT hash (or LM:NT pair), if used.
        aes_key: Kerberos AES key (32/64 hex), if used.
        ccache_path: Path to a Kerberos ccache, if used.
        auth_domain: Credential domain (where the account lives).
        domain: Target domain (enumeration target); used for SPN/KDC resolution.
        use_kerberos: Force Kerberos authentication.
        kdc_host: KDC FQDN/IP for Kerberos (defaults handled by transport).
        spn_host: Explicit Kerberos SPN hostname (FQDN) for the target.
        timeout: Per-connection timeout in seconds.

    Returns:
        An :class:`EffectiveAccess`. Inspect ``succeeded`` before trusting the
        access flags — see the dataclass docstring for the contract.

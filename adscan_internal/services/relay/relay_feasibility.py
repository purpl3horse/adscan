"""Pre-flight feasibility framework for NTLM-relay-to-LDAP attacks.

Single source of truth for deciding, BEFORE any network action, whether an
NTLM-relay-to-LDAP chain (coerce a victim's NTLM auth -> relay it to the DC's
LDAP -> write ``msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity`` (RBCD) or
``msDS-KeyCredentialLink`` (Shadow Credentials)) is viable against a given DC,
and WHY (or why not).

This module is a *read-only interpretation layer* over ADscan's existing
domain-posture system (:mod:`adscan_internal.services.domain_posture`). It
performs NO network I/O and NO exploitation. Every check reads the persisted
posture snapshot via :func:`get_posture` and reasons over
``ConstraintState.effective_state`` (so stale observations transparently
degrade to ``UNKNOWN`` -> the conservative baseline). It NEVER re-detects.

Design contract (spec 2026-06-01-ntlmv1-relay-ldap-feasibility-design, §§3, §5):

* The operator always gets an explicit go/no-go with the exact AD constraint
  that enables or blocks the attack -- never a silent timeout. The unit tests
  in ``tests/unit/services/relay/test_relay_feasibility.py`` ARE that "no
  silent timeout" contract.
* Each check is a small reusable callable (the :class:`RelayPrecondition`
  protocol) so individual checks (``ntlm_enabled``, ``ldap_signing``, ...) can
  be reused from other relay flows (ESC8, future targets).
* :func:`evaluate_relay_feasibility` is the aggregator: pure and deterministic
  given its inputs. It composes the verdicts into an overall
  :class:`RelayFeasibility` carrying ``viable``, the chosen relay ``target``,
  and the ordered list of :class:`FeasibilityVerdict`.

Correctness nuance baked into the composite target selector (spec §2):
drop-the-MIC (CVE-2019-1040) does NOT defeat ``LDAP_SIGNING=REQUIRED``. It only
works when LDAP signing is optional/WhenSupported. When signing is REQUIRED the
only SMB-sourced path left is relaying to LDAPS (TLS sealing sidesteps the 389
signing check) -- and that itself dies if LDAP channel binding is REQUIRED,
because an SMB source cannot supply a channel-binding token.

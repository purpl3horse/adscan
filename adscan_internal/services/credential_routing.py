"""Single source of truth for credential format classification.

ADscan resolves a credential out of the workspace as a plain string. The same
string can later end up in any of three credential fields on a transport
config: ``password``, ``nt_hash``, ``aes_key`` (and ``ccache_path`` for
ticket-based auth). When a string that is actually an NTLM hash lands in
``password``, the Kerberos client treats it as plaintext and derives the
wrong AES key from it — AS-REQ preauth fails with ``KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED``
even though the credential is materially correct.

This module exposes one helper, :func:`promote_credential_fields`, used by
every transport config's ``__post_init__`` to normalise the credential
fields. The helper is deliberately conservative: it only re-routes a value
when the format is unambiguous.

Format heuristics (only the first match wins):
- 32 hex characters → NT hash (NTLM format).
- ``LM:NT`` 65-character pair with a colon between two 32-hex halves → NT
  hash (legacy combined form; the NT half is what authenticates).
- AES keys live in ``aes_key`` only when the caller supplies them
  explicitly. AES-128 collides with NT hash on length, so we never demote a
  hash to AES.

The promotion is one-directional: ``password`` may be moved to ``nt_hash``,
never the other way around. A value already in ``nt_hash`` is trusted as-is.

"""Centralized Kerberos SPN resolution + NTLM-fallback decision.

Single source of truth for one recurring decision: a transport target may be
an IP address, but Kerberos service tickets cannot bind to ``cifs/<ip>`` /
``ldap/<ip>`` — the KDC/server reject it and the client only ever sees a
generic ``invalidCredentials`` / ``SEC_E_LOGON_DENIED`` (see
:mod:`adscan_internal.services._kerberos_spn`).

Before this module the IP→FQDN promotion and the NTLM-fallback decision were
scattered: some call sites wired ``ip_hostname_inventory`` into their config,
some relied on ``__post_init__`` promotion that cannot promote an IP, and the
LSASS-dump path passed the raw IP and let the hard guard abort the whole
operation with no NTLM fallback — even when NTLM-password auth would have
worked (the exact ``khal.drogo → BRAAVOS$`` regression).

This helper fuses the four inputs (target, domain, IP→hostname inventory /
``domains_data``, and the posture snapshot) into one decision so no future
call site has to remember the recipe. The pieces it composes already exist and
are tested individually:

- :func:`adscan_internal.services._kerberos_spn.is_ip_address` /
  :func:`normalize_kerberos_target_hostname`
- :func:`adscan_internal.services.kerberos_tcp_target.resolve_kerberos_tcp_target`
  (inventory → live PTR; returns the IP unchanged when nothing resolves)
- :func:`adscan_internal.services.kerberos_hostname_inventory.choose_hostname_for_kerberos_spn`
- :func:`adscan_internal.models.domain.resolve_dc_fqdn` (DC-specific chain)

Posture gating follows the canonical rule (see ``CLAUDE.md`` § "Posture
caching policy"): only an *observed* ``NTLM_AUTHENTICATION = DISABLED`` at
``HIGH`` confidence blocks the NTLM fallback. ``UNKNOWN`` / ``LOW`` (inferred
by absence, transient timeouts) must NOT block it — the fallback stays allowed.
This module only reads posture; it never emits a signal.

"""Proactive posture probe engine.

Runs lightweight, single-purpose probes against a Domain Controller to elicit
posture signals BEFORE the first real scan operation pays for the discovery.
Each probe targets exactly one ``ConstraintCategory``. All probes are
READ-ONLY and target only the DC the operator already pointed ADscan at —
same network scope as a regular ``start_unauth`` / ``start_auth`` phase.

Concurrency:
    - ``probe_unauth`` runs its four physical probes (U1/U4/U2/U3) FULLY
      SEQUENTIALLY — no ``asyncio.gather``. Concurrent execution caused
      event-loop starvation: the vendor TLS/NTLM path does not yield the
      loop cleanly, inflating each probe's wall-clock to seconds even though
      its real latency is ~50-150ms. See :func:`probe_unauth` docstring.
    - ``probe_auth`` Kerberos probes share the KDC connection — sequential;
      NTLM and SMB-signing probes are independent and still use
      ``asyncio.gather``.
    - ``timeout_per_probe`` is enforced per probe; one hung probe does not
      hang the others.

Idempotency:
    Re-running ``probe_unauth`` / ``probe_auth`` produces the same posture.
    Probes whose category is already known at HIGH confidence and not stale
    are skipped silently unless ``force=True``.

This module emits ``PostureSignal`` instances through the provided
``PostureSink``; it never touches the workspace directly. It does not print
to the console (only ``print_info_debug`` traces) and never wires itself into
``start.py`` — Batch 3 owns lifecycle integration.

# Probe schema version — bump this when a probe's logic changes in a way that
# invalidates previously-cached results. All ``_emit`` calls stamp the current
# version into the persisted ``ConstraintState``; the freshness check treats
# a version mismatch as STALE, forcing a re-probe.
#
# Why this exists. Posture caches persist for hours-to-days (24h default, 7d
# for structural Kerberos constraints). If a probe's logic changes (new
# technique, different signal classification, fixed false-positive path)
# without bumping this version, all existing caches keep returning the OLD
# probe's verdict until their natural TTL expires — even though the new
# code would yield a different (correct) answer. Bumping the version
# transparently invalidates every cache the moment the new code runs.
#
# When to bump:
#   * Probe technique changes (e.g. bind-based U1 -> TCP+TLS U1).
#   * Classification changes (e.g. ``timeout -> DISABLED HIGH`` becomes
#     ``timeout -> UNKNOWN LOW, no emit``).
#   * New states / signal codes that change downstream interpretation.
#
# When NOT to bump:
#   * Cosmetic changes (renamed variables, comments, refactors that don't
#     change emitted state/confidence/signal_code).
#   * Bug fixes that only affect failure paths NOT writing to the sink.
#
# Version history:
#   v1 (2026-05-26): Initial. Introduced alongside the U1 TCP+TLS rewrite
#                    and the cache-only-observations policy refactor; both
#                    invalidate any pre-existing posture cache.
#   v2 (2026-05-29): Added U4 (``_probe_ldap_starttls_available``) — a new
#                    probe with new states/signal codes (LDAP_STARTTLS_*),
#                    which changes downstream interpretation (new
#                    ``LDAP_STARTTLS_AVAILABLE`` category). Bumped so any
#                    workspace written by v1 re-probes on first contact.
#   v3 (2026-05-31): U2 (LDAP signing) and U3 (channel binding) rewritten
#                    to BIND-ONLY classification. The old technique ran a
#                    post-bind rootDSE search whose ``operationsError
#                    (ERROR_NOT_AUTHENTICATED)`` on RestrictAnonymous DCs
#                    (e.g. VulnLab Breach) masked the policy answer ->
#                    ``unknown`` -> PROBE_FAILED. v3 reads the raw BIND
#                    result instead (bind success = policy NOT required;
#                    strongerAuthRequired / SEC_E_BAD_BINDINGS = REQUIRED),
#                    uses a non-degrading random bogus principal, and adds
#                    an authenticated unsigned-bind tiebreaker (A5) when
#                    real creds are available and U2 stayed UNKNOWN. The
#                    classification rules changed, so bump to re-probe.
#   v4 (2026-06-02): probe_auth restructured to AUTH-first -> barrier ->
#                    SERVICE-after, with two classification changes that
#                    invalidate v3 caches for NTLM + SMB signing:
#                    * A3 (NTLM_AUTHENTICATION): the NTLM-disabled signature
#                      set was widened beyond SEC_E_LOGON_DENIED to also map
#                      SEC_E_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION / 0x80090302 /
#                      STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED / STATUS_NTLM_BLOCKED to
#                      DISABLED HIGH, with a new signal code
#                      NTLM_REFUSED_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION.
#                    * A4 (SMB_SIGNING): technique changed from a
#                      post-session-setup signing read to a pre-auth NEGOTIATE
#                      read; an observed NEGOTIATE that does not require signing
#                      is now a HIGH "not required" verdict
#                      (SMB_SIGNING_NEGOTIATED_NOT_REQUIRED), upgrading the old
#                      inconclusive SMB_SIGNING_NOT_NEGOTIATED UNKNOWN/LOW.
#                    Both change downstream interpretation, so bump to re-probe.
#   v5 (2026-06-02): CBT (LDAP_CHANNEL_BINDING) detection made auth-method-aware
#                    to fix a false "not enforced" on NTLM-DISABLED DCs:
#                    * U3 (NTLM-based CBT probe) now detects the NTLM-disabled
#                      SSP-collapse signature (SEC_E_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION /
#                      0x80090302 / STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED / STATUS_NTLM_BLOCKED,
#                      and SEC_E_LOGON_DENIED+invalidCredentials) at BOTH bind
#                      steps and returns UNKNOWN/LOW/no-emit
#                      (NTLM_UNAVAILABLE_CANNOT_MEASURE) instead of falling
#                      through to a HIGH "not enforced" verdict it could not
#                      actually observe.
#                    * New A6 Kerberos-path CBT probe measures channel-binding
#                      enforcement over the operational Kerberos LDAPS bind
#                      (no-CBT 16-zero token via disable_self_heal=True), gated
#                      to run only when A3 found NTLM disabled. New signal codes
#                      LDAP_CBT_REJECTED_BAD_BINDINGS_KERBEROS (REQUIRED) and
#                      LDAP_CBT_NOT_ENFORCED_KERBEROS (DISABLED), authoritative
#                      over U3 when NTLM is unavailable.
#                    Classification rules changed for LDAP_CHANNEL_BINDING, so
#                    bump to re-probe stale caches.
#   v6 (2026-06-02): LDAP signing (LDAP_SIGNING) detection made auth-method-aware
#                    to fix a false "signing not required" on NTLM-DISABLED DCs
#                    (mirrors the v5 CBT fix):
#                    * U2 (NTLM bogus-cred signing probe) now detects the
#                      NTLM-disabled SSP-collapse signature
#                      (SEC_E_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION / 0x80090302 /
#                      STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED / STATUS_NTLM_BLOCKED, and
#                      SEC_E_LOGON_DENIED+invalidCredentials) BEFORE
#                      classification and returns UNKNOWN/LOW/no-emit
#                      (NTLM_UNAVAILABLE_CANNOT_MEASURE) instead of mis-reading
#                      the SSP refusal as a "logon_failure -> signing not
#                      required" HIGH verdict. This stops U2 from pre-empting A5.
#                    * A5 (authenticated signing tiebreaker) is now
#                      NTLM-disabled-aware: when A3 found NTLM disabled it binds
#                      over KERBEROS (password/aes_key/ccache) on plain LDAP/389
#                      with the same unsigned (sign=False + disable_self_heal)
#                      measurement, so it can actually measure signing on a DC
#                      where the NTLM bind would collapse. Skips when only an IP
#                      is available (Kerberos needs an FQDN for the ldap/ SPN).
#                    Classification rules changed for LDAP_SIGNING, so bump to
#                    re-probe stale caches.

    """Probe U1 — LDAPS reachability AND functionality on TCP/636.

    The question this probe answers is: **"is LDAPS actually usable
    against this DC?"**. We discriminate three failure modes the
    posture system cares about distinctly:

    * ``LDAPS_PORT_CLOSED`` — TCP/636 returns RST or is unreachable.
      The port is not listening at all.
    * ``LDAPS_TLS_BROKEN`` — TCP/636 accepts the connection but the
      TLS handshake fails (cert expired, cipher mismatch, unsupported
      TLS version, broken cert chain). Port is open but LDAPS is not
      functional. Observed in real customer environments where a DC
      had a stale self-signed cert that no client could negotiate.
    * ``LDAPS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`` — neither side completes within
      the budget. Treat as DISABLED (any subsequent LDAPS operation
      would suffer the same hang).

    Two-step in a single call. ``asyncio.open_connection(ssl=ctx)``
    does TCP + TLS handshake in one shot, and the exception type
    discriminates the layer:

    * ``ConnectionRefusedError`` / generic ``OSError`` → TCP layer.
    * ``ssl.SSLError`` → TLS layer (TCP succeeded, handshake failed).
    * ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` → either layer hung past the budget.

    We deliberately do NOT speak LDAP after the TLS handshake. The
    posture question is "can we negotiate LDAPS"; what we'd do with
    the channel is a separate concern owned by ``_probe_ldap_signing``
    and ``_probe_ldaps_channel_binding``.

    Certificate validation is intentionally disabled (``CERT_NONE``,
    ``check_hostname=False``). AD DCs frequently present self-signed
    or domain-CA-issued certificates whose hostname does not match
    the DC's IP. A strict TLS context would reject those even though
    every real LDAPS client (impacket, badldap, native Windows) also
    accepts them. The goal is to mirror what a functional LDAPS
    client would see, not to validate the PKI.

    Why a short timeout (capped at 2s of the caller's budget): TLS
    handshake to a reachable DC on a LAN completes well under 200ms.
    Anything taking longer is either congested or filtered. A short
    cap also keeps the posture cycle bounded — U1's outcome gates U3,
    so a 5s wait here delays the entire unauth wave by 5s for nothing.

    """Probe U4 — StartTLS (RFC 2830) availability on plain LDAP/389.

    The question this probe answers is: **"can a plain LDAP/389 session be
    upgraded to TLS via StartTLS against this DC?"**. StartTLS is the only
    confidentiality mechanism that protects *anonymous/SIMPLE* binds without
    an LDAPS (636) listener, so its availability is a distinct posture fact
    from ``LDAPS_AVAILABLE`` — a DC can have 636 filtered yet still present a
    usable cert on 389, or vice-versa.

    Technique (modeled on :func:`_probe_ldaps_available`): open a raw
    ``MSLDAPClientConnection`` to ``ldap://<dc_ip>`` (plain 389, anonymous,
    no bind), then call the vendor StartTLS primitive
    (``MSLDAPClientConnection.starttls()`` in
    ``vendor/badldap/badldap/connection.py``). That primitive sends the
    StartTLS extendedReq (OID ``1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.20037``) and, on a success
    result code, wraps the socket in TLS. We never bind — the posture
    question is purely "does the StartTLS handshake complete", what we would
    do with the channel is a separate concern.

    Observed-vs-inferred discrimination (CLAUDE.md § Posture caching policy):

    * ``LDAP_STARTTLS_OK`` — extendedReq accepted AND TLS handshake completed
      (``starttls()`` returned ``ok=True``). ENABLED HIGH — OBSERVED.
    * ``LDAP_STARTTLS_REFUSED`` — extendedReq returned a non-success result
      code (``unwillingToPerform`` / refused), surfaced as
      ``LDAPBindException``. DISABLED HIGH — OBSERVED (the DC told us no).
    * ``LDAP_STARTTLS_TLS_BROKEN`` — extendedReq accepted but the TLS wrap
      raised ``ssl.SSLError`` (absent/broken/expired cert). DISABLED HIGH —
      OBSERVED.
    * ``LDAP_STARTTLS_PORT_CLOSED`` — TCP/389 refused or unreachable
      (``ConnectionRefusedError`` / ``OSError``). DISABLED HIGH — OBSERVED
      (the network layer answered).
    * ``LDAP_STARTTLS_TIMEOUT`` — ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` / event-loop
      saturation / anything we cannot classify. UNKNOWN LOW, **NO ``_emit``**
      — a timeout is an observation about OUR clock, not about the DC.
      Caching it would poison the category for 24h after a single transient
      hang (the exact bug class documented in CLAUDE.md § Posture caching
      policy, Invariant 2). The cache stays clean; the next caller re-probes.

    Certificate validation is intentionally disabled — AD DCs commonly
    present self-signed / domain-CA certs whose SAN does not match the IP we
    connect with, and the vendor target's SSL context mirrors what every real
    LDAPS/StartTLS client (impacket, badldap, native Windows) accepts. The
    goal is to mirror a functional client, not to validate the PKI.

# Bogus-credential constants — BIND-ONLY transport-policy probing
#
# U2 (signing) and U3 (CBT) ask the DC which **transport policy** is in force
# by attempting an LDAP BIND with bogus credentials over an unsigned / no-CBT
# channel, and reading the **bind result code** directly. Crucially the probe
# runs in BIND-ONLY mode (``bind_only=True`` in
# ``async_connect_with_ldap_fallback``): it stops after the bind and never
# issues the post-bind rootDSE search. The bind result tells us the policy:
#
#   * Policy REQUIRED -> the bind fails on the policy check with a
#     transport-specific code (``strongerAuthRequired`` for signing;
#     ``SEC_E_BAD_BINDINGS`` for CBT). The DC short-circuits BEFORE the
#     credential check, so the bogus credential never matters.
#   * Policy NOT required -> the unsigned / no-CBT bind is ACCEPTED at the
#     bind layer. (Against AD, an NTLM SICILY LDAP bind returns bind-level
#     ``success`` even for a non-existent principal — the credential is only
#     fully evaluated when a subsequent operation needs the security context.
#     So "bind accepted" is the definitive NOT-required signal here, observed
#     empirically against VulnLab Breach where ``nxc ldap`` reports
#     ``signing:None``.)
#
# Why BIND-ONLY and not the old post-bind-search technique: the previous
# design let badldap's ``client.connect()`` run ``get_serverinfo`` (a rootDSE
# SEARCH) after the bind. On a RestrictAnonymous DC that search returns
# ``operationsError (ERROR_NOT_AUTHENTICATED)`` — a SEARCH-level error that
# has nothing to do with the bind policy — and the classifier could only
# read ``unknown`` -> ``PROBE_FAILED``. Reading the bind result directly is
# the robust fix.
#
# Why a non-degrading bogus principal (NOT an anonymous bind): an anonymous
# LDAP bind can SUCCEED even when signing is enforced for AUTHENTICATED
# principals (the "LDAP server signing requirements" GPO may apply only to
# authenticated / SASL binds). NetExec's anonymous technique only POSITIVELY
# confirms enforced (``strongerAuthRequired``) and DEFAULTS every other
# outcome to "not enforced" -> false-negative risk. We deliberately do NOT
# copy that. We force a genuine AUTHENTICATED NTLM bind by using a RANDOM,
# almost-certainly-non-existent sAMAccountName per call (so it can never
# accidentally match a real account and lock it out) with a bogus password.
# A blank ``" "`` user is avoided because some stacks degrade it toward an
# anonymous bind, which would re-introduce the false-negative.
#
# Layered design — authenticated tiebreaker (A5): when the unauth bogus-cred
# probe returns UNKNOWN (e.g. a transient failure we could not classify) AND
# valid domain credentials are available (``start_auth`` phase), an OPTIONAL
# authenticated check runs an unsigned bind with the REAL credential. A
# successful unsigned authenticated bind is the most definitive possible
# "signing NOT required" signal. The unauth bogus-cred probe stays the
# PRIMARY path (works with no creds); A5 is a tiebreaker layer, not a
# replacement. See ``_probe_ldap_signing_authenticated``.
#
# OPSEC note: each bogus bind generates a ``4625`` audit event on the DC.
# NetExec produces the same event with every ``nxc ldap`` invocation, so this
# is industry-norm noise for an authorised engagement. Operators who need a
# quieter probe can opt out via ``ADSCAN_NO_POSTURE_PROBE=1``.

    """Probe A5 — authenticated LDAP-signing tiebreaker (real credentials).

    Runs ONLY as a tiebreaker: when the unauth bogus-cred U2 probe could not
    classify signing (stayed ``UNKNOWN``) AND valid domain credentials are
    available (``start_auth`` phase). It performs an UNSIGNED, BIND-ONLY bind
    with the REAL credential on port 389:

      * Bind SUCCEEDS (unsigned authenticated bind accepted) -> the most
        definitive possible "signing NOT required" signal — resolves
        RestrictAnonymous DCs like VulnLab Breach where the unauth probe's
        downstream signals were ambiguous. ``DISABLED`` HIGH, emit.
      * ``strongerAuthRequired`` -> signing REQUIRED. ``REQUIRED`` HIGH, emit.
      * Anything else (timeout, transport failure, even an auth failure —
        which tells us nothing about the signing policy) -> stay ``UNKNOWN``
        LOW, **no emit**.

    This is a LAYER on top of the primary unauth probe, never a replacement:
    the unauth path works with no creds and stays the default. See the
    ``_BOGUS_CRED_PASSWORD`` block comment for the layered-design rationale.

    Auth-method selection (mirrors A6's NTLM-disabled-aware design):
      * When NTLM is known-disabled (HIGH, fresh in the supplied in-flight
        ``posture``), an NTLM/SIMPLE unsigned bind would itself collapse in the
        SSP (``SEC_E_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION``) BEFORE the DC validates signing --
        the SAME trap that made U2 defer (Part A). A5 would then be unable to
        measure either. So on an NTLM-disabled DC A5 binds over KERBEROS
        (password/aes_key/ccache) on port 389, provided a DC FQDN is available
        for the ``ldap/`` SPN (an IP cannot target a Kerberos SPN -- CLAUDE.md
        § Kerberos SPNs). The just-merged LDAP-transport FIX1 pre-mints a
        salt-correct TGT via ``kerberos_transport.get_tgt`` for kerberos-password
        binds, so this works on non-default-salt / AES-only KDCs (ping.htb).
      * Otherwise (NTLM available, or no in-flight posture) A5 keeps the
        original NTLM/SIMPLE unsigned bind with password/NT-hash.

    Either way the bind is UNSIGNED (``sign=False`` + ``disable_self_heal=True``).
    ``disable_self_heal=True`` is load-bearing: it makes
    ``_apply_default_seal_to_plain_ldap`` SKIP the seal-by-default upgrade for
    authenticated plain-LDAP/389, so the bind stays unsigned (the measurement)
    and the reactive self-heal does not retry with sign+seal after a
    signing-required rejection. LDAP signing (``LdapServerIntegrity``) is
    enforced at the bind on plain LDAP/389, so the bind verdict is conclusive
    regardless of NTLM vs Kerberos: ``strongerAuthRequired`` -> REQUIRED;
    bind accepted / reached credential validation -> NOT_REQUIRED.

    Two-step probe modelled on NetExec's ``check_ldaps_cbt`` (see

    bind result is read directly (no post-bind rootDSE search that a
    RestrictAnonymous DC answers with ``operationsError`` — see the U2 probe
    and the ``_BOGUS_CRED_PASSWORD`` block comment):

      1. **No-CBT bind**. NTLM bind on LDAPS (port 636) with the CBT field
         omitted and a random bogus principal. The bind result:
           * ``SEC_E_BAD_BINDINGS`` (0x80090346) -> CBT enforced for ALL
             binds, regardless of credential validity. Emit ``REQUIRED`` HIGH

             CBT is not enforced for absent CBT — but the policy could still
             be "When Supported" (enforce CBT only when a token IS supplied).
             Go to step 2 to disambiguate.

      2. **Wrong-CBT bind**. Same NTLM bind, but with a deliberately invalid
         CBT token populated (``null_channel_binding`` -> ``_null_channel_binding``
         in the badldap connection). Bind result:

             is "When Supported". Emit ``REQUIRED`` HIGH (any client that
             sends CBT must send a valid one).
           * Bind ACCEPTED -> DC ignored the wrong CBT token entirely ->
             policy is "Never". Emit ``DISABLED`` HIGH.

    Anything else at either step (timeout, transport failure, an
    unclassifiable exception) -> ``UNKNOWN`` LOW, **no emit** (cache-only-
    observations policy). Skipped when LDAPS is known unavailable — CBT lives
    only on TLS.

    Operational note: each bogus bind generates a ``4625`` audit event on the

    """Probe A6 -- LDAPS channel-binding requirement via a KERBEROS bind.

    Authoritative replacement for U3 when NTLM is disabled. U3 measures CBT
    enforcement with a bogus-credential **NTLM** bind; on an NTLM-DISABLED DC
    that bind collapses in the SSP before the DC validates channel binding
    (``SEC_E_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION`` etc.), so U3 cannot measure and (per Part A)
    returns UNKNOWN/no-emit. This probe measures the SAME single LDAP policy
    (``LdapEnforceChannelBinding``) over the operational Kerberos auth path that
    every real ADscan LDAPS operation uses, so its verdict is authoritative.

    Methodology (validated empirically against ping.htb, 2026-06):

      * Build an LDAPS Kerberos bind config with ``channel_binding=False`` AND
        ``disable_self_heal=True``. The just-merged "default CBT-on for
        operational LDAPS binds" policy in
        ``ldap_transport_service._apply_default_cbt_to_authenticated_ldaps``
        SKIPS any config with ``disable_self_heal=True`` (or explicit
        ``channel_binding`` / ``null_channel_binding``) -- see that helper's
        discriminator:

            if (not is_ldaps
                or getattr(cfg, "disable_self_heal", False)
                or _config_requests_explicit_cbt(cfg)
                or not _plain_ldap_can_seal(cfg)):
                # left untouched

        ``disable_self_heal=True`` therefore guarantees the bind carries the
        16-zero "no bindings" GSS checksum token and is NOT silently upgraded
        to the real ``tls-server-end-point`` CBT -- which is exactly what makes
        the measurement possible. ``disable_self_heal=True`` ALSO stops the
        reactive self-heal from retrying with CBT after a ``SEC_E_BAD_BINDINGS``
        rejection, so the raw verdict bubbles up.

    Classification:
      * Bind raises ``SEC_E_BAD_BINDINGS`` -> the DC rejected a no-CBT
        Kerberos bind -> ``LDAP_CHANNEL_BINDING=REQUIRED`` HIGH (emit).
      * Bind succeeds (or reaches credential validation without a bad-bindings
        rejection) -> the DC accepted a no-CBT bind ->
        ``LDAP_CHANNEL_BINDING=NOT_REQUIRED`` (``DISABLED``) HIGH (emit).
      * Timeout / LDAPS-unreachable / unclassifiable -> ``UNKNOWN`` LOW, NO
        emit (observe-don't-infer, same policy as U3 and § 7bis of the
        AD-constraints checklist for slow links).

    The Kerberos SPN MUST be an FQDN, never an IP (CLAUDE.md § Kerberos SPNs).
    ``dc_fqdn`` is the caller-resolved FQDN (``resolve_dc_fqdn``); when absent
    we fall back to ``dc_ip`` only if it is itself a hostname. If only an IP is
    available the probe SKIPs (no FQDN -> a Kerberos bind cannot be attempted
    correctly), rather than minting a ticket against a wrong SPN.

    credential is presented, so this verdict does not depend on NTLM/Kerberos
    succeeding — it cannot hang on a Kerberos-only / NTLM-disabled DC (the

             :func:`_probe_ldap_signing`).
        U3 — ``LDAP_CHANNEL_BINDING`` (bogus-cred NTLM bind on LDAPS,
             two steps to disambiguate Required / When-Supported / Never;
             see :func:`_probe_ldaps_channel_binding`).
        U4 — ``LDAP_STARTTLS_AVAILABLE`` (StartTLS upgrade on plain
             LDAP/389, see :func:`_probe_ldap_starttls_available`).

    Concurrency layout — **fully sequential**: U1 → U4 → U2 → U3. No
    ``asyncio.gather``, no overlapping background tasks. Each probe runs to
    completion before the next one starts.

    Why fully sequential and not "fast handshakes in parallel, binds
    serialized": per-step instrumentation against a real DC (2026-05-29)
    proved that the vendor TLS/NTLM operations do NOT yield the event loop
    cleanly. The low-level network primitives are fast in isolation —
    ``async_connect_with_ldap_fallback`` completes in ~122ms and
    ``conn.connect()`` in 9-52ms — yet each probe's function-level
    wall-clock was ~3.7-8.7s whenever probes ran concurrently. The gap is
    NOT in ADscan code: it is event-loop starvation during the concurrent
    wave. The vendor TLS handshake and NTLM/SPNEGO negotiation block the
    loop long enough that the "parallel" probes serialize de-facto AND
    inflate each other's wall-clock past their ``asyncio.wait_for`` budgets,
    tripping spurious ``PROBE_TIMEOUT`` / ``LDAPS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`` even
    when LDAPS/StartTLS is perfectly reachable. The decisive proof: the
    sequential post-wave reads (password policy) ran in 17-152ms — fast
    when alone. So running the probes concurrently is SLOWER (and
    timeout-prone) than running them one at a time, where each probe
    measures its true ~50-150ms of real latency.

    Ordering preserves the one data dependency: U1 (``LDAPS_AVAILABLE``)
    must complete before U3 (``LDAP_CHANNEL_BINDING``), because U3's
    self-skip consults U1's verdict via ``posture_for_u3`` (CBT lives only
    on TLS — no point binding LDAPS when U1 already proved 636 is closed).
    Sequential ordering satisfies this naturally; ``posture_for_u3`` is
    still built from U1's finished result below.

    Deferred alternative (backlog): making the vendor SSL/NTLM operations
    non-blocking — e.g. running the blocking handshake/negotiation under
    ``loop.run_in_executor`` so they genuinely yield the loop — would let
    these probes run in true parallel and reclaim the wall-clock. That is a
    vendor-layer change with wider blast radius; until then, sequential is
    both faster (no contention inflation) and timeout-safe.

    Evolution of this layout (kept for the historical record): the earliest
    "all probes parallel" design wasted ~10s on DCs without LDAPS (U3 burned
    two 5s timeouts on a question U1 had already answered). Intermediate
    designs — "U1+U2 parallel, U3 after", then "U1+U4 parallel + U2 then
    U3 sequential" — each removed one race but left another (a spurious
    ``LDAPS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`` from the U1↔bind contention, or a U2↔U3
    overlap). Full sequentialisation removes every remaining race in one
    move; the cost (one probe's latency at a time, all at their true
    ~50-150ms) is lower than the concurrent design's contention-inflated
    wall-clock.

    Why these live in UNAUTH even though they exercise an NTLM bind:
    the bogus-credential technique (see ``_BOGUS_CRED_PASSWORD`` comment
    block) does not require a real principal — it only exercises the
    DC's transport-policy validation, which runs **before** credential
    validation. So the same code path produces an authoritative answer
    in ``start_unauth`` and ``start_auth``, no second pass required.

    Args:
        domain: Target Kerberos realm / AD domain.
        dc_ip: DC IP to probe.
        sink: Posture sink that receives every emitted signal.
        on_progress: Optional callback fired twice per physical probe
            (``(cat, None)`` start, ``(cat, result)`` finish).
        timeout_per_probe: Per-probe wall-clock cap, seconds.
        force: When ``True``, run every probe even if the posture already
            records a HIGH-confidence non-stale value for its category.
        posture: Optional pre-loaded ``DomainPosture`` used for skip logic.

    Returns:
        One ``ProbeResult`` per physical probe, in the order
        ``[U1, U2, U3, U4]``.

    """Run the auth-mechanism probe set against the DC.

    The auth phase exists to characterise the **credential and Kerberos
    machinery**, nothing else. Properties of the DC that can be measured
    without credentials (LDAP signing requirement, LDAPS channel binding
    requirement) live in :func:`probe_unauth` so the same answer surfaces
    in ``start_unauth`` and ``start_auth``, and the AUTH phase stays
    purely about what authentication actually requires a credential.

    Probes (4 physical core + 2 conditional, 6 distinct posture signals):
        A1 — ``KERBEROS_RC4`` + ``KERBEROS_AES_ONLY`` (one explicit-etype AS-REQ).
        A2 — ``KERBEROS_ETYPE_PROBE``.
        A3 — ``NTLM_AUTHENTICATION``.
        A4 — ``SMB_SIGNING``.
        A6 — ``LDAP_CHANNEL_BINDING`` Kerberos-path probe (conditional; runs
             ONLY when A3 found NTLM disabled, the case where the unauth U3
             NTLM-based CBT probe could not measure). Authoritative.
        A5 — ``LDAP_SIGNING`` authenticated tiebreaker (conditional).

    Ordering — AUTH-first -> barrier -> SERVICE-after:

        AUTH GROUP (sequential): A1 -> A2 -> A3. Each consumes what the prior
        learned. Fully sequential for the same event-loop-starvation reason the
        unauth phase was sequentialised (vendor TLS/NTLM ops do not yield the
        loop cleanly; "parallel" probes serialize de-facto and inflate each
        other's wall-clock past their wait_for budgets).

        BARRIER: the AUTH group is fully awaited before the SERVICE group
        starts. The finished AUTH verdicts are layered onto the caller's
        posture via :func:`_layer_auth_verdicts` to build an in-flight overlay
        (only HIGH/observed/succeeded verdicts), mirroring ``posture_for_u3``.

        SERVICE GROUP: A4 (SMB signing) consumes the in-flight overlay so it
        sees A3's ``NTLM_AUTHENTICATION=DISABLED`` and A1's
        ``KERBEROS_AES_ONLY`` computed seconds earlier — its §4.2 fallback can
        then pick Kerberos on a Kerberos-only DC instead of forcing NTLM. A6
        (Kerberos-path CBT) consumes the same overlay and runs ONLY when A3
        found NTLM disabled — it is the authoritative CBT measurement in that
        case (U3's NTLM-based probe is blind on NTLM-disabled DCs). A5
        (LDAP-signing tiebreaker) runs after, unchanged.

    This replaces the old single-wave ``asyncio.gather(_kerberos_group(),
    _independent_group())`` in which A4 ran before/alongside the Kerberos and
    NTLM verdicts and could not consume them (DEFECT A4 root cause).

    Probes whose required credential type is missing are skipped silently
    (``ProbeResult.skipped=True``, no sink call).

    Args:
        domain: Target Kerberos realm / AD domain.
        dc_ip: DC IP to probe.
        creds: Credential bundle.
        sink: Posture sink that receives every emitted signal.
        on_progress: Optional callback fired twice per physical probe.
        timeout_per_probe: Per-probe wall-clock cap, seconds.
        force: When ``True``, ignore existing fresh HIGH posture and re-run.
        posture: Optional pre-loaded ``DomainPosture`` used for skip logic.

    Args (continued):
        dc_fqdn: Optional caller-resolved DC FQDN (``resolve_dc_fqdn``) for the
            A6 Kerberos-path CBT probe's ``ldap/`` SPN. When absent the probe
            falls back to ``dc_ip`` only if it is a hostname; an IP-only DC
            makes A6 skip (a Kerberos SPN cannot be an IP).

    Returns:
        ``ProbeResult`` entries in the order ``[A1, A2, A3, A4, (A6?), (A5?)]``
        — order preserved for callers/tests. A6 is appended only when it ran
        (NTLM disabled + Kerberos credential), A5 only when it ran.

    Live-first resolution (never primarily trusts a stale collector artifact):

    1. **Live LDAP read** — domain default via :func:`probe_password_policy`
       (reused through :func:`get_password_policy`); when ``target_user`` is
       given, the per-user PSO via :func:`_resolve_pso_policy`
       (authoritative ``msDS-ResultantPSO`` BASE read, precedence fallback).
    2. **In-session cache** keyed by ``(domain, target_user_or_None)`` so a
       300-attempt spray reads the policy once. ``force_refresh=True`` busts it.
    3. **Collector / persisted** as last resort (best-effort; the JSON
       reverse-loader is deferred to a later phase — see note below).
    4. **Strong safe default** (``min_length=14``, complexity required,
       ``source="default_assumed"``) when everything else is unavailable.

    Connection handling reuses the mandatory ADscan LDAPS->LDAP fallback
    (``async_connect_with_ldap_fallback`` via ``ADscanLDAPConfig``); this
    function never imports ``LDAPConnectionFactory`` directly.

    Args:
        domain: Target Kerberos realm / AD domain.
        dc_ip: DC IP for the target domain.
        target_user: sAMAccountName or UPN to resolve a PSO for. ``None`` =
            domain default only.
        username, password, nt_hash, ccache_path, use_kerberos: bind creds.
        domains_data: Workspace mapping for the domain-default cache leg.
        force_refresh: Bypass both caches and re-read live.
        timeout: Per-LDAP-operation wall-clock cap, seconds.

    Returns:
        A :class:`~adscan_internal.services.domain_posture.ResultantPasswordPolicy`.
        Always returns a usable policy — never ``None`` (worst case the strong
        safe default).

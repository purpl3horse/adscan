"""Async WinRM transport facade for the post-exploitation executor.

Phase 5 of the attack-graph refactor needs a way to drive the existing
post-exploitation techniques (see
:mod:`adscan_internal.services.post_exploitation`) over a real WinRM
session. The technique executors expose a pluggable
``RemoteRunner = Callable[[FootholdContext, str], Awaitable[str]]``
contract so the transport choice is decoupled from the technique logic.

Architecture decision (documented inline so future readers do not have
to dig through PR history):

* CLAUDE.md "subprocess paths are legacy" forbids spawning
  ``evil-winrm`` subprocesses for new code. ``reference/awinrm`` is
  a different (incompatible) library and is not currently wired into the
  ADscan stack. There is no async-native WinRM transport in the kerbad /
  badldap / aiosmb / asysocks family at the time of this phase.
* ADscan already ships ``WinRMPSRPService`` (see
  ``services/winrm_psrp_service.py``), which wraps the in-tree
  ``pypsrp[kerberos]`` dependency, supports NTLM, password, hash, and
  Kerberos ccache auth, and exposes
  :py:meth:`WinRMPSRPService.async_execute_powershell` which already
  delegates the blocking ``pypsrp`` call to a thread executor.
* Therefore the right move for Phase 5 is to layer a small async
  transport facade on top of ``WinRMPSRPService`` and inject it as the
  default ``RemoteRunner``. When a fully native async WinRM transport
  appears in ``reference/`` (post Phase 5b), only the body of
  :func:`winrm_run_powershell` needs to change — the public facade and
  the post-ex contract stay stable.

Public API:

* :class:`WinRMResult` — structured return value (stdout/stderr/exit-ish).
* :func:`winrm_run_powershell` — async entry point for one-shot PowerShell.
* :func:`make_post_ex_remote_runner` — factory returning a
  ``RemoteRunner`` callable suitable for the post-ex executors.

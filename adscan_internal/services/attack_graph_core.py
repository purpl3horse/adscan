"""Attack graph core utilities (pure functions).

This module contains the core logic for computing attack paths from an
`attack_graph.json` structure. It is intentionally written without any
dependency on the interactive CLI "shell" object, so it can be reused by both
the CLI and the web backend.

Notes:
    - The core functions operate on the in-memory attack graph dict structure
      (schema_version 1.1). Callers are responsible for loading/saving files.
    - Callers may optionally "enrich" the graph (e.g., inject runtime MemberOf
      edges) before calling these functions. The core treats the graph as the
      source of truth and performs no network calls.

# ── Access-edge gating — arrival != ownership ──────────────────────────────
# Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-01-access-edge-gating-followups-design.md
#
# An access edge (EdgeKind.AUTH: CanPSRemote, CanRDP, ExecuteDCOM, AdminTo,
# SQLAdmin, SQLAccess) terminates in a *session on a host*.  It does NOT confer
# the host principal's outbound graph privileges.  After an access-edge arrival
# the host's raw outbound *control / escalation / membership* edges are withheld;
# the path may continue only via a follow-up the access type unlocks.
#
# The ONLY follow-up that re-enables the host's own outbound control edges is the
# self-credential DumpLSA bridge (reads the host machine account secret →
# "becomes" the host Computer principal).  It is unlocked ONLY by LOCAL-ADMIN
# access (AdminTo / ReadLAPSPassword), never by a user-level WinRM / RDP session.
#
# Implementation note on the AdminTo case: a *direct* host control edge after a
# bare AdminTo (no DumpLSA) is already blocked by the credential-context guard
# (AdminTo provides local_admin_session; a control edge requires user_credentials,
# which local_admin_session does not satisfy), and the implicit DumpLSA overlay
# re-enables it.  The gate below closes the remaining gap: the *user-level* access
# edges (CanPSRemote / CanRDP / ExecuteDCOM / SQLAccess) were context-transparent,
# so a credential recovered BEFORE the access edge leaked the host's control edges
# straight through the pivot.  This is the HTB Pirate false-positive factory:
#   ReadGMSAPassword → CanPSRemote → DC01$ → ADCSESC7 → DOMAIN ADMINS.
#
# EdgeKinds that represent traversing the HOST's own outbound privileges (and so
# must be withheld after a non-self-credential access arrival).  AUTH and TRUST
# edges are not host-control traversals; DERIVED edges are follow-ups (handled by
# the self-credential bridge logic), so they are not gated here.

    Unlike ``_collect_share_exposure_rows`` (which derives data from path search
    results and inherits attack-path DFS rules like max_depth, target_mode, and
    max_paths cap), this function reads share-access edges directly from the raw
    graph. It applies no depth limit, no target filter, and no path cap — the
    result is an exhaustive inventory of every ReadShare / WriteShare /
    FullControlShare edge that exists in the graph at the time of the call.

    Args:
        graph: Raw attack graph dict (``nodes`` + ``edges``).
        domain_sid: Optional domain SID (``S-1-5-21-...``). When supplied,
            ``<domain_sid>-513`` is recognised as ``Domain Users``.
        limit: Maximum number of rows to return (ranked by risk). ``None`` means unbounded (return every share-access row).

        ``_render_share_resources_panel``.  Each dict contains: ``host``,
        ``share``, ``access`` (set), ``principals`` (set), ``choke`` (bool),
        ``impact_rank`` (int 0-3), ``admin_share`` (bool).

            This prevents dropping ``A→B`` just because ``A→B→C`` exists — B and C
            are different exploitable targets.  When False (domain scope), all
            sub-sequences are marked as covered/shadowed regardless of their
            terminal, giving the most compact holistic view.  In the

    Matching (F5 Fix #1 — context-insensitive): "A is a prefix of B" is decided on

    the other structural relations are stripped and ``X→DumpLSA→X`` self-loops are
    collapsed — NOT on the literal node/rel arrays. This is what lets a path
    truncated at the Domain Controllers group be recognized as a prefix of the full
    ``…→DCSync→Domain`` kill chain even though the full path's rendered arrays carry
    an extra DumpLSA self-loop node and a different terminal. The DISPLAYED records
    are untouched; only the matching key is context-insensitive.

    Dominance (F5 Fix #2 — 4-tier total order): a prefix A is dropped by a
    containing super-path B iff A's core is a strict prefix of B's core AND
    ``domain_compromise_tier(B) >= domain_compromise_tier(A)`` on the operator-defined
    total order ``T4 Domain object > T3 direct-breaker group > T2 enabler > T1 host``.

    * collapses redundant domain-tier prefixes (a T3 ``…→Domain Controllers`` path is
      dropped in favour of the T4 ``…→DCSync→Domain`` super-path it prefixes);
    * preserves the F1 anti-regression — a T4 Domain-object prefix is NEVER dropped by
      a longer lower-tier super-path (``1 >= 4`` is False), so the headline
      domain-compromise path always survives a host-terminal extension.

    The legacy ``_outcome_class_rank`` guard is intentionally NOT re-applied here: the
    4-tier domain-compromise order is the finer, authoritative dominance for domain
    outcomes (e.g. it distinguishes the Domain object from a direct-breaker group,
    which both map to outcome rank 100 and would otherwise tie). This runs *after* the
    within-target contained-path filter, so it only deals with cross-target prefix
    relationships (different terminal nodes).

    Ntlmv1RelayRBCD, SPNJack, and AllowedToDelegate with protocol transition),
    injects a synthetic ``Computer -> DCSync -> <Domain object>`` edge.

    AD rationale: an admin/SYSTEM context on a writable DC can DCSync directly.
    Running as SYSTEM IS the DC machine account, which is a member of Domain
    Controllers and holds DS-Replication-Get-Changes / -All on the domain head;
    impersonating Administrator (RID 500) likewise yields a Domain Admin with
    replication rights. So the admin ticket replicates the domain credentials
    *immediately*, without first dumping the machine account from LSA secrets.

    This is injected IN ADDITION to (never replacing) the DumpLSA self-loop from
    :func:`_build_implicit_dumplsa_overlay`. The two are distinct techniques:
    the direct edge is the fastest domain compromise; the DumpLSA path also
    extracts the durable machine-account credential (persistence / offline /
    cross-host reuse). Their attack cores diverge (``...,DCSync`` vs
    ``...,DumpLSA,...,DCSync``) so both survive the display filters.

    Scoped to **writable** DCs only — an RODC machine account holds only partial
    secrets and no full GetChangesAll, so it keeps DumpLSA-only.

    ``HasSession`` is an ACCESS edge (``EdgeKind.AUTH``): ``Computer ->
    HasSession -> User`` means a logon session of ``User`` exists on the host.
    Arriving at the user is NOT ownership — you must LEVERAGE the session to
    "become" the user. Two techniques do so, both modelled here as a derived
    self-loop on the session-user node (``User -> <technique> -> User``):

      * ``ScheduledTask`` — register a Task Scheduler task whose principal IS the
        session user (``InteractiveToken``), running code under their existing
        logon session (the implemented native path, ``hassession_native``).
      * ``DumpLSASS`` — dump the session user's credentials from the host LSASS.

    Both carry ``compromise_semantics=direct_target_compromise`` (provides
    ``credential_recovered``), so after the follow-up the path may traverse the
    session user's OWN outbound edges (``MemberOf -> Administrators -> DCSync ->
    Domain``, etc.).

    Self-gating — the credential-context guard only lets these chain when the
    immediately-preceding non-transparent edge produced ``local_admin_session``.
    Among edges that target a USER node that is uniquely ``HasSession``
    (``access_capability_only``); control edges that land on a user (GenericAll,
    ForceChangePassword, ...) produce ``credential_recovered``, which does NOT
    satisfy ``local_admin_session``, so the guard withholds the follow-ups there.
    The follow-ups also cannot self-chain (after one runs the context is
    ``credential_recovered``, not ``local_admin_session``), so exactly the two
    divergent variants are generated, never an explosion.

    CRITICAL — this is intentionally the ONLY follow-up set ``HasSession``
    unlocks. It does NOT receive the host self-credential follow-ups (``DumpLSA``
    / ``DumpDPAPI`` / ``DumpSAM``) that a local-admin Computer arrival gets:

# Administrators, etc.), the DFS expands ``MemberOf`` through every one,
# producing one near-identical path per group. The kill chain is the same
# story: ``... → Administrator → MemberOf → <DA|EA|Administrators> → ...``.
# Only the group label changes.
#
# Rule: when a principal has multiple ``MemberOf`` outgoing edges to
# direct-compromise groups, follow ONLY the highest-priority group. The
# membership info for other groups stays in the persisted graph (and in
# memberships.json) for choke-point analysis, reporting, and BloodHound

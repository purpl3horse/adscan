"""Centralized credential recovery for the USER_NOT_FOUND verification verdict.

When a recovered credential (autologon, GPP, LSASS, DPAPI, manual entry,
attack-path) is verified and the DC answers
``KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN`` (``CredentialStatus.USER_NOT_FOUND``), the
stored username is a lossy pointer to whoever actually owns the credential.
This module turns that dead-end into a recovery flow built on a single mental
model:

    The password is the verification oracle; the username is just a pointer.

So the question is never "fix the typo" but "which known account does this
secret authenticate as". Two complementary paths answer it:

* **Fuzzy fast path** — rank the failed username against the enumerated user
  list (stdlib :func:`difflib.get_close_matches`) and verify the most-likely
  owners with the recovered secret, stopping at the first VALID. OPSEC-bounded
  to a hard cap of distinct accounts so it can never degrade into an unbounded
  mini-spray (one auth attempt per distinct account = lockout-safe by
  construction).
* **Spray fallback** — when no fuzzy candidate verifies (or none exist), offer
  the existing lockout-safe spray engine across the known user list. The spray
  engine is a black box here: this module only invokes it, never reimplements
  its scope/lockout logic.

The recovery is invoked from the single choke point
``PentestShell.verify_domain_credentials`` (its ``USER_NOT_FOUND`` branch). The
protocol boundaries (candidate verification, spray, credential persistence) are
injected as callables so the orchestration is unit-testable without touching
the Kerberos or spray protocols.

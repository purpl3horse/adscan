"""Canonical unauth user inventory — single source of truth.

The unauthenticated reconnaissance phase pulls user records from two sources
that overlap but neither dominates:

* **LDAP anonymous bind** — returns `samaccountname`, `distinguishedName`,
  `description`, `userAccountControl` (often withheld on hardened DCs),
  `lastLogonTimestamp`. Misses users hidden by ACLs.
* **SMB null session → SAMR** — returns `username`, `RID`, `description`,
  `fullName`, `comment`. Catches users LDAP withholds (e.g. Forest exposes
  `svc-alfresco` via SAMR but not via anon LDAP).

Historically each probe wrote its own JSON (``ldap_anonymous_active_users.json``,
``samr_users.json``, ``samr_descriptions.json``) and every downstream consumer
(AS-REP roasting, password spraying, attack-graph feed, report renderer) had
to re-merge them. That made every consumer carry merge logic and made
provenance ("which probe found this user?") impossible to recover.

This module is the single point that:

1. Merges both sources into :class:`UnauthUser` records keyed by
   case-insensitive ``samaccountname``.
2. Tracks ``sources`` so the report can cite "discovered via SAMR + LDAP".
3. Picks the richest field across sources (longest description, RID from
   SAMR, DN from LDAP, UAC if any side returned it).
4. Writes a canonical ``domains/<dom>/users.json`` plus a
   ``domains/<dom>/users.txt`` derived from it for tool consumption
   (``run_asreproast`` and friends read the .txt).

Consumers should read ``users.json`` — the per-probe artefacts are gone.
GPP cpassword leaks remain in their own store (``gpp_leaks.json``); they
are credentials, not users.

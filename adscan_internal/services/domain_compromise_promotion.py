"""Single source of truth for promoting a domain to ``pwned`` state.

Multiple code paths discover that the engagement has reached "domain
compromise" — Domain Admin group membership, krbtgt hash extraction,
NTDS dump, etc. Before this module each of those paths duplicated the
same telemetry / session-state / victory-hint / CTF-trigger sequence,
which was both error-prone and hard to evolve.

Call :func:`promote_to_pwned` from every such path. It is idempotent —
the second call for the same domain returns ``False`` and is a no-op.

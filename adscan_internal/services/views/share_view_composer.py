"""Compose live + graph views of SMB shares into a unified operator model.

Two upstream services answer different questions about shares:

* :mod:`services.enumeration.smb_shares_native` answers
  *"what can the credential I am using right now actually do?"*
  via ``SMB tree_connect → maximal_access``.

* :mod:`services.collector.share_collector` answers
  *"who can do what to this share according to the security descriptor?"*
  and persists the result as ACL edges in ``attack_graph.json``.

Both are valuable; neither replaces the other. This composer fuses them
into a :class:`ShareView` per share with three perspectives — ``live``,
``graph``, and a computed :class:`ShareDelta` highlighting where the two
disagree (typically the highest-signal observation: the live credential
exceeds what the collector mapped, meaning the operator just discovered
access that the graph did not know about).

The composer is pure logic: no network, no I/O beyond what the upstream
services already produced. Tests can drive every delta case with mocked
inputs.

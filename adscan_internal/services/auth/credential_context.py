"""Credential context + invalidation registry for Kerberos PAC freshness.

Problem this module solves
==========================

A pentesting workflow chains privilege-granting steps:

    Step 1: AddMember(svc-alfresco -> Exchange Trusted Subsystem)
    Step 2: WriteDACL(DC=htb,DC=local) using svc-alfresco's TGT
            -> insufficientAccessRights

Step 2 fails because the TGT cached in svc-alfresco's ccache was minted
**before** Step 1 modified group membership.  The PAC inside that TGT does
not contain the new group SIDs, so the DC's access token is built without
the privileges that the on-disk ACL says svc-alfresco now has.  The wire
ACL is correct; the failure is purely PAC freshness.

Design — defence in depth
=========================

Three layered staleness criteria, evaluated in this order inside
``refresh_if_stale``:

1. **Wall-clock timestamp** (primary).  ``CredentialRegistry`` records the
   timestamp of every invalidation.  If the on-disk ccache's mtime is older
   than the latest invalidation that could have affected this principal, the
   ticket is stale regardless of when the context was constructed.  This is
   the invariant that survives "context built after invalidation" races —
   the ccache file pre-dates the mutation, so it cannot contain its effects.

2. **Epoch counter** (fallback).  Kept for back-compat and for the case where
   the ccache file does not exist on disk yet.  Compares the registry's
   current epoch against ``issued_at_epoch`` snapshotted at TGT-mint time.

3. **Force flag**.  ``refresh_if_stale(force=True)`` skips both checks and
   refreshes unconditionally.  Used by the transport-level auto-retry
   (``services/auth/auth_retry.py``) when a bind raises
   ``insufficientAccessRights`` despite the staleness checks above passing.

Both primitives below are async-friendly but synchronous-callable:
``refresh_if_stale`` is an ``async def`` so the LDAP / Kerberos transports
(already async) can call it without blocking the loop.  Sync callers go
through ``ADscanLDAPConnection.__enter__`` which already drives the loop.

Cross-domain
============

Epochs and timestamps are tracked per ``(principal, realm)`` AND per realm.
``epoch_for`` and ``last_invalidate_at_for`` return ``max(principal, realm)``
so a realm-wide invalidation transparently invalidates every principal.  A
``invalidate_domain`` helper covers structural mutations (AdminSDHolder,
domain-wide password resets) that affect every principal in a realm.

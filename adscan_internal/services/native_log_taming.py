"""Single source of truth for taming third-party (vendor) logging noise.

ADscan integrates a sizable surface of third-party libraries — the native AD
stack (aiosmb, msldap, kerbad, asysocks, badldap, badauth, minikerberos,
winacl, asyauth, asyldap), credential parsers (pypykatz), and stdlib loggers
that emit benign chatter as a side-effect of how we use them (asyncio).

These libraries pollute the user's terminal through **four distinct channels**,
each with its own remedy. This module is the canonical place for all four —
do not invent parallel mechanisms in other modules.

================================================================================
Channel 1 — stdlib ``logging`` (rogue StreamHandler at import time)
================================================================================
Native-stack libs install their own ``StreamHandler`` and write raw lines like
``2026-05-02 08:07:36,863 aiosmb ERROR ...`` straight to stderr, bypassing
Rich. :func:`tame_native_stack_loggers` strips those handlers, forces
``propagate=True``, attaches :class:`BenignNativeNoiseFilter` to drop
known-benign post-teardown chatter (SMB ``CONNECTION_ABORTED``, SPNEGO/NEGOEX
cleanup, late callbacks), and attaches the :class:`_NativeStackBridgeHandler`
so the surviving records reach ADscan's centralized output (see "Native-stack
logging bridge" below).

================================================================================
Channel 2 — stdlib ``logging`` (handler-less vendor loggers)
================================================================================
Some vendors (``pypykatz``, ``asyncio``) don't add their own handlers — they
just propagate. We don't need to strip anything, only filter benign noise via
the same :class:`BenignNativeNoiseFilter`. Add the logger name to
:data:`_NATIVE_STACK_LOGGER_NAMES` (handler-stripping is a no-op when there
are no handlers to strip) and the substring to
:data:`BENIGN_NATIVE_NOISE_MARKERS`.

================================================================================
Channel 3 — vendor ``log_callback`` mechanism (bypasses logging entirely)
================================================================================
aiosmb and badldap relay servers use a ``log_callback`` parameter that, by
default, calls ``print()`` directly to stdout. :func:`make_relay_log_callback`
produces a replacement callback that filters lifecycle chatter and packet
dumps and routes the rest through ADscan's ``print_info_debug``. Pass it when
constructing ``SMBServerSettings`` / ``LDAPServerSettings``.

================================================================================
Channel 4 — direct ``print()`` / ``traceback.print_exc()`` in vendor source
================================================================================
Some vendor code prints raw bytes / tracebacks directly (asyauth SPNEGO server,
aiosmb relay exception handlers). These bypass everything. Because ``vendor/``
is committed and IS what ships, the fix is to **patch the vendor file
directly** — silence the print, replace the traceback with ``pass``, or route
through the available callback if one exists. See git history for examples in
``vendor/aiosmb/aiosmb/relay/serverconnection.py`` and
``vendor/asyauth/asyauth/protocols/spnego/server/native.py``.

================================================================================
Native-stack logging bridge (Channel 1 routing)
================================================================================
The native-stack vendor loggers (``aiosmb``, ``badldap``, ``kerbad``,
``winacl``, ``pypykatz``, …) are NOT children of the ``adscan`` logger — they
propagate to the *root* logger, which carries none of ADscan's RichHandlers
(those attach to the ``adscan`` logger, which itself has ``propagate=False``).
Consequently their records reach neither the session telemetry recording nor
the visible console; they only ever surfaced through Python's ``lastResort``
fallback to stderr.

:class:`_NativeStackBridgeHandler` closes that gap WITHOUT touching the vendor
source (the whole point — the fix survives ``scripts/refresh_vendor.sh``). A
single shared instance is attached ONLY to the top-level prefix loggers in
:data:`_NATIVE_STACK_LOGGER_PREFIXES` (``aiosmb``, ``badauth``, ``asysocks``,
…) — never to their children. A record originating on a child logger (e.g.
``badauth.ntlm``) propagates up to its prefix logger (``badauth``), where the
shared bridge fires EXACTLY ONCE. Attaching the bridge to both parent AND child
(as an earlier version did) made every child record emit twice — once on the
child, once again on the parent via propagation — flooding the recording with
duplicate lines. The stdlib ``Logger.callHandlers`` contract guarantees the
single-prefix attach is sufficient: during propagation it walks the parent
chain and fires each handler gated ONLY by ``record.levelno >= handler.level``
(it does NOT re-check ancestor logger effective levels), and the bridge
handler's own level is ``DEBUG`` — so a DEBUG/INFO child record still reaches
the prefix-attached bridge.

The bridge forwards each surviving record to:

* **Telemetry — WARNING and above only.** The record is rendered to the
  telemetry console (``record=True`` buffer) resolved via
  ``adscan_core.output._state._get_telemetry_console`` only when
  ``record.levelno >= logging.WARNING``. Vendor DEBUG/INFO is extremely chatty
  (per-NTLM-message granularity: every Flags/sealkey/signkey/negotiate line)
  and would flood every uploaded recording while needlessly widening the
  secret-exposure surface; it is therefore kept OUT of the always-on telemetry
  buffer. What survives (WARNING+ / ERROR) is scrubbed by the export-time,
  source-agnostic, fail-closed sanitizer in ``telemetry.py`` — plus the
  LAYER-2 :func:`scrub_native_secrets` applied here before the line is queued.
* **Visible console — only under ``--debug`` (all levels, DEBUG+).** When
  ``adscan_core.output._state.is_debug_mode()`` is ``True`` the record is also
  rendered to the shared ``_TeeConsole`` (``get_console()``) so the operator
  can follow the full vendor stream live. ``_TeeConsole.print`` auto-mirrors to
  telemetry, which would re-introduce the DEBUG flood into the recording via
  the console path — so this print is wrapped in
  ``adscan_core.output._state._explicit_telemetry_mirror`` to suppress the
  auto-mirror. The visible ``--debug`` stream therefore does NOT leak vendor
  DEBUG/INFO back into telemetry. During a ``LiveSession`` the deferred-flush
  still captures it because the capture path is separate from the telemetry
  mirror (it appends to the active deferred buffer regardless of the
  auto-mirror opt-out).

Net result: the telemetry recording holds the operator narrative (``print_*``)
plus vendor WARNING+/ERROR only; vendor DEBUG/INFO is a ``--debug``-console
convenience that never reaches the uploaded buffer.

The handler keeps ``propagate=True`` on the vendor loggers untouched: it is a
purely *additive* sink, so the existing/legacy propagation contract (and any
future root handler) is preserved. Because the handler lives only on the
vendor prefix loggers — never on ``adscan`` or root — ADscan's own records are
never double-recorded by it. The handler is best-effort: it never raises,
mirroring the ``_TeeConsole.print`` try/except discipline, so a broken
telemetry buffer can never break the visible flow.

================================================================================
NTLM-handshake noise tier (logger-scoped, ``--debug``-only volume control)
================================================================================
The ``badauth.ntlm`` logger emits a full per-handshake state-machine trace at
DEBUG for EVERY authentication attempt (``Negotiate message constructed``,
``Setting Client sealkey ...``, ``KeyExchangeKey derived``, ``Flags: ...``,
etc.). The NTLMv1 coercion sweep drives dozens-to-hundreds of handshakes
(hosts × coercion methods × pipes), so these markers flood the ``--debug``
console with zero operator-diagnostic value: the NTLMv1/NTLMv2 classification
is already in the sweep results table, and each attempt's outcome is already in
the ADscan-level ``attempt`` / ``completed`` / ``attempt failed`` lines.

:data:`_NTLM_HANDSHAKE_NOISE_MARKERS` lists the high-frequency, zero-value
substrings. :class:`BenignNativeNoiseFilter` drops a record whose
``record.name`` is the NTLM logger (``badauth.ntlm``) AND whose level is
``DEBUG`` AND whose message matches a marker. This filtering is deliberately
SCOPED to ``badauth.ntlm`` and kept SEPARATE from the logger-agnostic
:data:`BENIGN_NATIVE_NOISE_MARKERS`: the bare ``Flags:`` marker, for instance,
must drop NTLM flag chatter but NEVER ``badauth.kerberos`` flags (Kerberos
flags can matter). Because the filter is attached to BOTH the native loggers
and the bridge handler, a dropped record disappears from the visible console
AND telemetry — exactly the intended effect.

**Escape hatch — ``ADSCAN_VENDOR_DEBUG=1``.** A developer who genuinely needs
the raw NTLM handshake trace back can set ``ADSCAN_VENDOR_DEBUG=1`` in the
environment; the NTLM-handshake drop is then skipped (the global benign-noise
markers still apply). Default (env unset) drops the chatter. This does NOT
touch the WARNING+ telemetry gate or the bridge de-dup — only the ``--debug``
console volume of pure handshake markers.

================================================================================
Secret scrubbing (LAYER 2 of the no-exfiltration defence)
================================================================================
Independent of noise control, every line the bridge forwards is passed through
:func:`scrub_native_secrets` — re-exported from the dependency-light SSOT
:mod:`adscan_core.native_secret_scrub` — BEFORE it reaches the telemetry buffer
or the ``--debug`` console. LAYER 1 is the vendor-source redaction (the
``# ADSCAN: do not dump ...`` edits in ``vendor/badauth``); LAYER 2 exists
because ``scripts/refresh_vendor.sh`` can silently re-introduce a raw dump. The
scrubber redacts protocol-recognizable material with NO label (NTLMSSP messages,
NetNTLM hashcat lines, challenge byte-reprs) AND label-gated crypto-key /
Kerberos-ticket blobs — see that module for the detector inventory and the
false-positive guard. The SAME function is applied whole-buffer, fail-closed at
telemetry export time (``adscan_core.telemetry``), so material that never
travelled through the bridge (e.g. ``--debug`` console mirroring of a vendor
``print()``) is still redacted before upload.

================================================================================
Lifecycle
================================================================================
Call :func:`tame_native_stack_loggers` exactly once at runtime startup, right
after ``init_logging`` has configured the root Rich console handler. The
function is idempotent — subsequent calls are no-ops.

    Routes messages through ADscan's output system instead of bare ``print()``:

    - Raw packet dumps (``[PACKET]``) are dropped — they are binary noise that
      is never useful to the user.
    - Messages matching :data:`BENIGN_NATIVE_NOISE_MARKERS` are dropped
      silently (SPNEGO teardown, session-key errors, NEGTOKEN chatter, etc.).
    - ``[ERR]`` messages that survive both filters go to ``print_info_debug``
      so they appear in the debug log file without polluting the UI.
    - All other messages (``[INF]``, ``[DBG]``) go to ``print_info_debug``.

        context: Short label shown in the debug message (e.g. ``"smb-relay"``).

    """Strip rogue handlers, install the benign-noise filter and the bridge.

    Idempotent — subsequent calls are no-ops. Safe to invoke before any of the
    native libraries are imported: loggers that do not yet exist are created
    on demand by :func:`logging.getLogger`, the (empty) handler list is left
    alone, and the filter remains in place if/when the library is loaded
    later. Once the library imports and adds its own handler, that handler is
    not retroactively stripped — call this function after ``init_logging``
    and *before* any native-stack import to guarantee a clean console.

    Two passes:

    1. **Over every name in** :data:`_NATIVE_STACK_LOGGER_NAMES` (parents AND
       children): strip rogue import-time handlers, force ``propagate=True``,
       lower the logger to ``DEBUG`` so vendor ``logger.debug()`` /
       ``logger.info()`` records are actually CREATED (otherwise NOTSET loggers
       inherit root's effective WARNING level — ``--debug`` only lowers the
       ``"adscan"`` logger, see ``logging_config.py`` — and the level check
       inside ``Logger.debug()`` drops the record before any handler sees it),
       and attach :class:`BenignNativeNoiseFilter`.
    2. **Over the top-level prefixes in** :data:`_NATIVE_STACK_LOGGER_PREFIXES`
       ONLY: attach the single shared :class:`_NativeStackBridgeHandler`
       (identity-guarded). Children deliberately do NOT carry the bridge: a
       child record propagates up to its prefix logger where the bridge fires
       exactly once. Attaching to both parent and child would double-emit every
       child record (see the module docstring's propagation-contract note).

    The bridge is purely additive; ``propagate`` is left ``True`` so the
    existing propagation contract is untouched.

"""Open files on the user's desktop from any ADscan flow.

ADscan runs inside a Docker container that has no GUI session: a bare
``xdg-open`` call would either silently fail or never reach the user's
desktop. This module routes the open request through the host helper
socket (mounted at ``ADSCAN_HOST_HELPER_SOCK``), which validates the path
and dispatches the opener as the invoking host user.

Outside the container the module falls back to ``xdg-open`` / ``open`` /
``os.startfile`` so the same call works in dev (``uv run adscan``) and in
production.

Public API
----------
- :func:`open_workspace_file` — single entry point used by demo, deliver,
  generate_report, and anyone else who wants "open this artefact for the
  user when they ask for it."

The helper validates that the path lives under the invoker's workspaces
tree on the host side, so adding new call sites here cannot escalate into
arbitrary host-file exposure.

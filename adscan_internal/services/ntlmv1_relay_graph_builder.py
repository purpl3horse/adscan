"""Materialize NTLMv1 coerce→relay / offline-crack attack steps into the graph.

Sub-project #3 (+ refinement 2026-06-02b). Reads the per-host NTLMv1 verdicts
written by sub-project #2 (``domains_data[domain]["ntlm_auth_type_by_host"]`` —
see ``adscan_internal/cli/ntlm_capture.py``) and, for each host that
authenticates with NTLMv1, materializes:

* the ``Ntlmv1Enabled`` surface marker (a finding on its own — like the CVE
  scanner's ``PrinterBugSurface``), as a derived edge ``ADscan → Computer X``;
* three THEORETICAL escalation edges ``Domain Users → Computer X``:
  ``Ntlmv1RelayRBCD`` (admin-capability → DumpLSA chains),
  ``Ntlmv1RelayShadowCreds`` (credential-granting → no DumpLSA), and
  ``CrackNTLMv1`` (offline crack — the most universal avenue, no relay target,
  no reflection/signing/CBT/ADCS dependency → credential-granting, no DumpLSA).

The three escalation edges are ``EdgeKind.ESCALATION``, so they cannot go
through ``insert_derived_edge`` (which only accepts ``EdgeKind.DERIVED``); the
persistence function writes them straight to ``attack_graph.json`` with the
same idempotent signature pattern used by ``attack_graph_derived``. The planning
function (:func:`plan_ntlmv1_relay_edges`) is pure (no disk) so it is
unit-testable.

Reflection gate (refinement 1): NTLM relay cannot be reflected to the SAME host
(post-CVE-2019-1384 reflection mitigations), so both RELAY edges require a relay
target distinct from the coerced node. When the coerced node is the only DC in
the domain, no eligible relay target exists and both relay edges are emitted
``blocked`` (never silently dropped). ``CrackNTLMv1`` is exempt — it has no relay
target.

Blocked-state evaluation (``status="blocked"`` + ``notes["blocked_reason"]``) is
wired in via the ``feasibility_for_host`` callback; :func:`compute_host_feasibility`
builds that callback's verdicts from ``relay_feasibility.evaluate_relay_feasibility``
(the single source of truth for relay viability) plus the reflection gate.
